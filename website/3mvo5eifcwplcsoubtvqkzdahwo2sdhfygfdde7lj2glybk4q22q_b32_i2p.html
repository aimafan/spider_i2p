<p>As is the nature of an alternative network, a lot domain names for common clearnet sites
have already been registered by other people. So I have taken the time to register the domain
names co.i2p and in.i2p, so that if a legitimate clearnet website wishes to establish a presence in I2P
but finds example.i2p is taken, they can obtain example.co.i2p through me. This is because
in order to register a 3LD or 4LD with any of the existing nameservices, you require control
of the corresponding 2LD or 3LD; by already registering co.i2p, the clearnet website is almost
guaranteed that example.co.i2p is no already taken.</p>

<p>There are two ways this could work:</p>

<ul>
<li>The clearnet website contacts me and asks for example.co.i2p. I create a tunnel to get a
destination hash and corresponding private key, and then register example.co.i2p with that
destination hash. Finally, I send the clearnet website the private key to enable them to use
the example.co.i2p URL.
<ul>
<li>This has the downside that if I somehow were feeling malicious, I could keep a copy of the
private key and partly hijack the URL (via multihoming). Or more likely, the key could be taken
in transit to the clearnet website.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The clearnet website creates a tunnel to obtain a destination hash, and then attempts to register
example.co.i2p with that destination hash. They are informed by the nameservice that they need
to create a verification file on the 2LD (co.i2p). They inform me of who they are, why they
desire an I2P URL and what the verification file is. I create the verification file on co.i2p
enabling them to complete registration of example.co.i2p and then remove it afterwards.
<ul>
<li>This method ensures that the clearnet website receives and maintains sole control of the
example.co.i2p URL. However, it requires some sort of confirmation of identity, as they provide
the verification code rather than me sending the private key to a known contact address of the
website, and there is the possibility of the website being impersonated in order to get the
URL registered.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This domain is registered and maintained by <a href="http://str4d.i2p">str4d</a>; contact
him to request a *.co.i2p or *.in.i2p subdomain.</p>
