<p>Hello!</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, we have had some downtime during the last 24 hours. We have upgraded our server from Fedora 35 to Fedora 37. Apparently it was really outdated and somewhat broken. Luckily it is fixed now -- we hope!</p>
<p>If you find any issues, feel free to tell us over on XMPP or e-mail. My contact can be found here: <a href="https://blog.qwik.space/about">https://blog.qwik.space/about</a> or <a href="https://qwik.space/#contact">https://qwik.space/#contact</a></p>

<p>Okay, I finally found why I couldn't use my SSH.</p>
<p>It is a, in my opinion, really dumb problem. My <code>$HOME</code>-dir
had the mode <code>775</code> (<code>drwxrwxr-x</code>) instead of <code>755</code> (<code>drwxr-xr-x</code>).
That is apparently a <em>silent</em> problem. No errors/logs said
anything more than something along the lines of
<code>Pubkey authentication failed: Permission denied</code>.
It should, in my opinion, say something along the lines of
<code>Authentication failed: improper permissions. (See https://link.to/solution/or/problem)</code>.
And the link would tell you what permission shit needs to be.</p>

remove posts unless I do it manually from the
filesystem. That is quite annoying. I also kinda
want to implement an RSS-feed, as well as
perma-links for posts, and maybe even some search
functionality...</p>
<p>I hope I feel I have the energy and time one day.</p>
<p>Til then, have it great y'all!</p>

<p>The actual state of Linux is that shit depends on speical
GNU features in <code>glibc</code>. So using something like <code>musl</code> is
really bloody difficult -- if not almost impossible.</p>
<p>Apparently AppImages don't even work on musl, even if their
slogan is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux apps that run anywhere</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I actaully feel so bullshitted. It should be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux apps that run on (<em>the correct version of</em>) glibc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't run anywhere. It doesn't run on musl! They also
mention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Download an application, make it executable, and run! No need to install. No system libraries or system preferences are altered. Can also run in a sandbox like Firejail</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which also seems like a blatant lie -- maybe not lie, but
false information...</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/issues/1112">It is not an unknown issue either...</a>]</p>
<p>So yeah... Nice thing that I might have to distrohop because
shit depends on non-standard features. A libc-implementation
should only provide a C library. Other features would go in
other libraries!</p>
<p>Urgh...</p>

It is probably "write a news article for this news

national tests that are actually made to purposefully
mislead you into selection wrong answers on a multiple

<p>For context: national tests are standardised tests in

<p>Right now I have no (convenient) way of editing or removing posts...
(As in via the web interface...)</p>
<p>In one way I like that: it makes me forced to live with mistakes I make.
However, on the other hand, I would also like to correct myself.
Although that is very doable by just sending a new post...</p>
<p>I also have plans to implement perma-links to posts, which means
that I would be able to more easily reference other posts.</p>
<p>I should also paginate posts. I don't think it is a great idea
to serve one hundred posts on the homepage, once I inevitably
get to that amount... Also searching for posts would be nice...
It is somewhat easy to implement, it would just take time...</p>
