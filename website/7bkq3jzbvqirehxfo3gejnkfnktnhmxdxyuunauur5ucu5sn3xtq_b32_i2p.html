From a report:<i> "My guess is that we'll have AI that is smarter than any one human probably around the end of next year," said the billionaire entrepreneur, who runs Tesla, X and SpaceX. Within the next five years, the capabilities of AI will probably exceed that of all humans, Musk predicted on Monday during an interview on X with Nicolai Tangen, the chief executive of Norges Bank Investment Management.<br><br> Musk has been consistently bullish on the development of so-called artificial general intelligence, AI tools so powerful they can beat the most capable individuals in any domain. But Monday's prediction is ahead of schedules he and others have previously forecast. Last year, he predicted "full" AGI would be achieved by 2029. Some of Musk's boldest predictions, such as rolling out self-driving Teslas and landing a rocket on Mars, have not yet been fulfilled. A number of AI breakthroughs over the past 18 months, including the launch of video generation tools and more capable chatbots, have pushed the frontier of AI forward faster than expected. Demis Hassabis, the co-founder of Google's DeepMind, predicted earlier this year that AGI could be achieved by 2030.<br><br> The pace of development has been slowed by a bottleneck in the supply of microchips, particularly those produced by Nvidia, which are essential for training and running AI models. Those constraints were easing, Musk said, but new models are now testing other data centre equipment and the electricity grid. "Last year it was chip constrained ... people could not get enough Nvidia chips. This year it's transitioning to a voltage transformer supply. In a year or two [the constraint is] just electricity supply," he said.</i></div></div></article><article id="fh-173475996" class="fhitem fhitem-story article usermode thumbs grid_24"><header><span class="topic"><a href="/index2.pl?fhfilter=usa"><img src="/i/usa_64.png&amp;output=webp&amp;q=80" title="United States"></a></span><h2 class="story"><span class="s-title"><a href="/story/24/04/08/2052220/fcc-chair-rejects-call-to-impose-universal-service-fees-on-broadband">FCC Chair Rejects Call To Impose Universal Service Fees on Broadband</a><span class="extlnk"><a class="s-sourcelnk" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="//arstechnica.i2p/tech-policy/2024/04/fcc-chair-rejects-call-to-impose-universal-service-fees-on-broadband/"> (arstechnica.i2p) </a></span></span><span class="comment-bubble"><a href="/story/24/04/08/2052220/fcc-chair-rejects-call-to-impose-universal-service-fees-on-broadband#comments">10</a></span></h2><div class="details"><span class="s-details"><span class="s-views"><span></span></span></span><span class="s-byline"> Posted by msmash <time> on Monday April 08, 2024 @04:52PM</time> from the <span class="dept-text">how-about-that</span> dept. </span></div></header><div class="body"><div class="p"> The Federal Communications Commission chair <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="//arstechnica.i2p/tech-policy/2024/04/fcc-chair-rejects-call-to-impose-universal-service-fees-on-broadband/">decided not to impose Universal Service fees on Internet service</a>, rejecting arguments for new assessments to shore up an FCC fund that subsidizes broadband network expansions and provides discounts to low-income consumers. From a report:<i> The $8 billion-a-year Universal Service Fund (USF) pays for FCC programs such as Lifeline discounts and Rural Digital Opportunity Fund deployment grants for ISPs. Phone companies must pay a percentage of their revenue into the fund, and telcos generally pass those fees on to consumers with a "Universal Service" line item on telephone bills.<br><br> Imposing similar assessments on broadband could increase the Universal Service Fund's size and/or reduce the charges on phone service, spreading the burden more evenly across different types of telecommunications services. Some consumer advocates want the FCC to increase the fund in order to replace the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), a different government program that gives $30 monthly broadband discounts to people with low incomes but is about to run out of money because of inaction by Congress. The Universal Service funding question is coming up now because, on April 25, the FCC is scheduled to vote on reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service in order to re-impose the net neutrality rules scrapped during the Trump era. Imposing Universal Service charges on broadband would likely result in ISPs adding those costs to monthly bills and would make the net neutrality proceeding even more of a political minefield than it already is. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel's net neutrality proposal takes the same stance against requiring Universal Service contributions that the FCC took in 2015 when it first imposed the net neutrality rules.</i></div></div></article><article id="fh-173475218" class="fhitem fhitem-story article usermode thumbs grid_24"><header><span class="topic"><a href="/index2.pl?fhfilter=microsoft"><img src="/assets/microsoft.png" title="Microsoft"></a></span><h2 class="story"><span class="s-title"><a href="/story/24/04/08/1850249/microsoft-is-confident-windows-on-arm-could-finally-beat-apple-silicon-powered-macs">Microsoft is Confident Windows on Arm Could Finally Beat Apple Silicon-Powered Macs</a></span><span class="comment-bubble"><a href="/story/24/04/08/1850249/microsoft-is-confident-windows-on-arm-could-finally-beat-apple-silicon-powered-macs#comments">89</a></span></h2><div class="details"><span class="s-details"><span class="s-views"><span></span></span></span><span class="s-byline"> Posted by msmash <time> on Monday April 08, 2024 @02:50PM</time> from the <span class="dept-text">shape-of-things-to-come</span> dept. </span></div></header><div class="body"><div class="p"> An anonymous reader <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/8/24116587/microsoft-macbook-air-surface-arm-qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite">shares a report</a>:<i> Microsoft is getting ready to fully unveil its vision for "AI PCs" next month at an event in Seattle. Sources familiar with Microsoft's plans tell The Verge that Microsoft is confident that a round of new Arm-powered Windows laptops will beat Apple's M3-powered MacBook Air both in CPU performance and AI-accelerated tasks. After years of failed promises from Qualcomm, Microsoft believes the upcoming Snapdragon X Elite processors will finally offer the performance it has been looking for to push Windows on Arm much more aggressively. Microsoft is now betting big on Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon X Elite processors, which will ship in a variety of Windows laptops this year and Microsoft's latest consumer-focused Surface hardware.<br><br> Microsoft is so confident in these new Qualcomm chips that it's planning a number of demos that will show how these processors will be faster than an M3 MacBook Air for CPU tasks, AI acceleration, and even app emulation. Microsoft claims, in internal documents seen by The Verge, that these new Windows AI PCs will have "faster app emulation than Rosetta 2" -- the application compatibility layer that Apple uses on its Apple Silicon Macs to translate apps compiled for 64-bit Intel processors to Apple's own processors.<br><br> App emulation has been a big problem for Windows on Arm over the past decade, but Microsoft did deliver x64 app emulation for Windows 11 more than two years ago. This helps ensure apps can run on Windows on Arm devices when there isn't a native ARM64 version. Native Arm apps are key for improved performance on upcoming Windows on Arm laptops, and Google has just recently released its own ARM64 version of Chrome ready for these upcoming devices.</i></div></div></article><article id="fh-173474056" class="fhitem fhitem-story article usermode thumbs grid_24"><header><span class="topic"><a href="/index2.pl?fhfilter=yro"><img src="/i/yro_64.png&amp;output=webp&amp;q=80" title="Your Rights Online"></a></span><h2 class="story"><span class="s-title"><a href="/story/24/04/08/1512219/crypto-scam-criminal-trial-tests-code-is-law-claim-by-trader">Crypto Scam Criminal Trial Tests 'Code Is Law' Claim by Trader</a><span class="extlnk"><a class="s-sourcelnk" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-08/crypto-scam-criminal-trial-tests-code-is-law-claim-by-trader"> (bloomberg.com) </a></span></span><span class="comment-bubble"><a href="/story/24/04/08/1512219/crypto-scam-criminal-trial-tests-code-is-law-claim-by-trader#comments">73</a></span></h2><div class="details"><span class="s-details"><span class="s-views"><span></span></span></span><span class="s-byline"> Posted by msmash <time> on Monday April 08, 2024 @12:00PM</time> from the <span class="dept-text">closer-look</span> dept. </span></div></header><div class="body"><div class="p"> A jailed trader accused of stealing $110 million on the Mango Markets exchange <a href="/story/22/12/28/162232/us-charges-fraud-in-mango-crypto-manipulation-case">charged Avraham Eisenberg with manipulating Mango Markets</a> futures contracts on Oct. 11, 2022, to boost the price of swaps by 1,300% in 20 minutes. He then "borrowed" from the exchange against the inflated value of those contracts, a move the government claims was a theft. Jury selection begins Monday in New York federal court, where groundbreaking crypto cases have played out. FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced there last month to 25 years in prison for orchestrating a multibillion-dollar scheme, while Terraform Labs Pte. and co-founder Do Kwon were found liable Friday for fraud in civil trial over the firm's 2022 collapse, which wiped out $40 billion in investor assets.<br><br> Eisenberg, a self-described "applied game theorist," claims his actions weren't theft at all. Rather, he says, he legally exploited a weakness in the decentralized finance application. The trial will apparently be the first time a US criminal jury will weigh what type of "DeFi" transactions are legal. In the crypto world, where digital blockchains govern who owns what, the virtual ecosystem is built around the notion that "code is law." It means that if something isn't explicitly forbidden by terms of a crypto platform, then government can't intercede. But prosecutors say those rules can't protect traders against possible criminal charges for market manipulation or fraud.</div></div></article><article id="fh-173474002" class="fhitem fhitem-story article usermode thumbs grid_24"><header><span class="topic"><a href="/index2.pl?fhfilter=xbox"><img src="/i/xbox_64.png&amp;output=webp&amp;q=80" title="XBox (Games)"></a></span><h2 class="story"><span class="s-title"><a href="/story/24/04/08/153243/xbox-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-console">Xbox Moving 'Full Speed Ahead' on Next Gen Console</a><span class="extlnk"><a class="s-sourcelnk" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xbox-president-sarah-bond-has-set-up-a-new-team-dedicated-to-game-preservation-and-forward-compatibility"> (windowscentral.com) </a></span></span><span class="comment-bubble"><a href="/story/24/04/08/153243/xbox-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-console#comments">35</a></span></h2><div class="details"><span class="s-details"><span class="s-views"><span></span></span></span><span class="s-byline"> Posted by msmash <time> on Monday April 08, 2024 @11:03AM</time> from the <span class="dept-text">up-next</span> dept. </span></div></header><div class="body"><div class="p"> Microsoft is <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xbox-president-sarah-bond-has-set-up-a-new-team-dedicated-to-game-preservation-and-forward-compatibility">moving "full speed ahead" on its next generation console</a>, an internal email from Xbox president Sarah Bond has revealed.

Sunday he published an expose on "a yearslong decline of safety standards" at Boeing.<br><br> After a 1997 merger, its new executive leaders "treated experienced engineers and machinists as expendable, ignoring the potential damage to Boeing's essential mission of designing and building high-quality airplanes...." <i> The arc of Boeing's fall can be traced back a quarter century, to when its leaders elevated the interests of shareholders above all others, said Richard Aboulafia, industry analyst with AeroDynamic Advisory. "Crush the workers. Share price. Share price. Share price. Financial moves and metrics come first," was Boeing's philosophy, he said. It was, he said, "a ruthless effort to cut costs without any realization of what it could do to capabilities...." Its leaders outsourced work, sold off whole divisions and discarded key capabilities such as <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/electronics-outsourcing-weakened-boeingrsquos-control-over-787rsquos-crucial-systems/">developing avionics</a>, <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-sells-fabrication-plant/">machining parts</a> and <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=20040125&amp;slug=boeing25">building fuselages</a>.

They <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-shifting-engineering-work-to-california-s-carolina/">moved work away from Boeing's highly skilled, unionized base</a> in the Puget Sound region. They weakened unions and extorted state government with repeated <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-launches-hunt-for-777x-site/">threats to build future airplanes elsewhere</a>. They <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/local-aerospace-suppliers-say-they-feel-squeezed-by-boeing/">squeezed suppliers by demanding price cuts every year</a> that in turn forced the suppliers into ruinous cost-cutting and left them vulnerable to collapse during shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic....<br><br> Belatedly, Boeing's current leaders, overwhelmed by criticism, mockery and outrage since January, have finally admitted publicly that some key strategies they pursued for decades were flawed. "Boeing, more than 20 years ago, probably got a little too far ahead of itself on the topic of outsourcing," Chief Financial Officer Brian West said last month. And in January, on CNBC, Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun conceded: "Did it go too far? Yeah, probably did."<br><br> Both were speaking about major supplier Spirit AeroSystems of Wichita, Kan., part of Boeing until it was sold off two decades ago, part of a broad divestment of assets to please Wall Street and boost the stock. Following a litany of quality lapses in Wichita, Boeing is now admitting a mistake and trying to buy Spirit back — "for safety and for quality," said West. Another mistake belatedly recognized: With annual bonuses for Boeing's factory managers based largely on meeting cost and schedule targets, it was long a cardinal sin to stop the assembly line. That meant unfinished jobs piled up on aircraft as they moved forward down the line, what Boeing calls "traveled work." Done out of sequence, this work is more difficult and takes much longer. If too much traveled work piles up, it creates chaos. That's what happened in Renton on the 737 assembly line. "For years, we prioritized the movement of the airplane through the factory over getting it done right, and that's got to change," West said. "Once you reduce traveled work, your quality gets better...." <br><br> Speaking of how Spirit might be fixed, West said: "It's really about focus and running it, not as a business, as a factory. Run it as a factory and stay focused on safety and quality and stability."</i><br> Phil Chandler, a highly skilled Boeing machinist for more than 42 years (retiring in 2020), saw a "dictatorial" approach on the factory floor, according to the article. "Whereas in the past, first-level and even second-level managers in the factory had come up through the ranks as mechanics and had deep knowledge of the work, after [Boeing president Harry] Stonecipher came in those jobs shifted to white-collar people with degrees, often with MBAs."<br><br> And a former Boeing physicist also complains about the "shoot-the-messenger" management approach when developing their 787, according to the article: "Engineers who raised technical doubts were told: 'Follow the plan. If you can't do your job, I'll fire you and get someone who can.'"</div></div></article><article id="fh-173459866" class="fhitem fhitem-story article usermode thumbs grid_24"><header><span class="topic"><a href="/index2.pl?fhfilter=earth"><img src="/i/earth_64.png&amp;output=webp&amp;q=80" title="Earth"></a></span><h2 class="story"><span class="s-title"><a href="/story/24/04/06/0438257/one-of-disneylands-longest-running-attractions-is-ditching-fossil-fuels">One of Disneyland's Longest-Running Attractions is Ditching Fossil Fuels</a><span class="extlnk"><a class="s-sourcelnk" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/heres-the-latest-change-disneyland-is-making-to-tomorrowland-3028520/amp/"> (reviewjournal.com) </a></span></span><span class="comment-bubble"><a href="/story/24/04/06/0438257/one-of-disneylands-longest-running-attractions-is-ditching-fossil-fuels#comments">91</a></span></h2><div class="details"><span class="s-details"><span class="s-views"><span></span></span></span><span class="s-byline"> Posted by EditorDavid <time> on Monday April 08, 2024 @04:34AM</time> from the <span class="dept-text">Tomorrowland</span> dept. </span></div></header><div class="body"><div class="p"> When Disneyland opened in 1955, its car-themed attraction <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://yesterland.com/chevronautopia.html">Autopia</a> "represented the future of what would become America's multilane limited-access highways," <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="//wikiless.i2p/wiki/Autopia">according to Wikipedia</a>, " which were still being developed. President Eisenhower had yet to sign the Interstate Highway legislation..."<br><br> Wikipedia adds that the cars "generate a moderate level of exhaust from the Honda GX gasoline engines that propel the cars." But that may change, according to a <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/heres-the-latest-change-disneyland-is-making-to-tomorrowland-3028520/amp/">climate-oriented newsletter from the <em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>: <i>If anyone could get away with defending the toxic odor, it might be Bob Gurr. He designed the original Autopia cars in the mid-1950s, working closely with Walt himself. He's proud of what they built together. But today the 92-year-old <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://d23.com/walt-disney-legend/bob-gurr/">Disney legend</a> says the polluting motors need to go. "Get rid of those God-awful gasoline fumes," he told me.<br><br> Disney is finally preparing to do just that. In news shared exclusively with The Times ahead of this column's publication — after several weeks of my prodding the company for answers on the future of Autopia — Disney officials revealed that pure gasoline engines are on their way out... "As the industry moves toward alternative fuel sources, we have developed a roadmap to electrify this attraction and are evaluating technology that will enable us to convert from gas engines in the next few years," spokesperson Jessica Good said in an email. Good wouldn't confirm whether that means electric vehicles, or if hybrids are a possibility...<br><br> [Gurr] also expressed a grander vision for Tomorrowland as a hub for stories about renewable energy, public transit and other sustainable technologies that will help us create a better tomorrow... [H]ow about using the former Innoventions building, which once displayed futuristic technologies but is now <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.micechat.com/331420-news-disneyland-tomorrowland-dvc-lounge/">closed</a> to most guests, to showcase solar panels, lithium-ion batteries and other clean energy devices that guests might want in their homes...? Why not switch to electric cooking at the Alien Pizza Planet restaurant, and offer induction stove demos for diners? Maybe start screening some National Geographic films (Disney owns NatGeo) at the largely unused Magic Eye Theater...? Add some infotainment-style signs and voice-overs about the wonders of clean energy and public transit, and boom, you've got a Tomorrowland that should leave kids and their parents excited to help build a safer, happier, more sustainable world...<br><br> [Gurr] told me that if he could, he'd tear out everything in Tomorrowland except the Monorail and rebuild it as a version of the public transit-oriented <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="//wikiless.i2p/wiki/EPCOT_(concept)">futuristic city</a> that Walt once planned for Florida — only with clean energy at the core of its storytelling... At the very least, he said it's time for an Autopia where guests "don't smell the fumes, don't hear that racket of the little motor going putt-putt-putt."</i><br> The newsletter agrees electric vehicles for Autopia are "the obvious starting point" for remodeling Tomorrowland with "a buzz of optimism and futuristic energy." ("Solar-panel shade structures over the line would be great too.") They even add that "it's not that it's my job to make money for Disney, but I'm sure the company could find sponsors for this vision of Tomorrowland. There are plenty of renewable energy companies, electric utilities and environmental groups eager to tout their causes and their credentials."<br><br> And it shares this observation from climate scientist and communicator Katharine Hayhoe (paraphrasing another scientist who studies climate communications): "Showing people what climate solutions look like is one of the most effective ways to get them to support action." The newsletter's conclusion? "This is where Tomorrowland could prove especially valuable in the fight to save the planet."<br><br><br><em>Some additional context...

The pair had an audacious goal to commercialize what until very recently was promising but ultimately small-scale research into the effects of microgravity on pharmaceutical crystals... Astronauts have been conducting protein crystallization experiments in space for decades on the International Space Station and before that, the Space Shuttle. But the business case for expanding this research has never materialized — until now... <br><br> Part of the reason Varda is possible today is due to the availability of regular, low-cost rideshare launches from SpaceX and Rocket Lab's innovations in satellite bus manufacturing. Even beyond these external partnerships, the startup has made significant headway in its own right, as the success of the first mission showed: Their reentry capsule appears to have performed flawlessly and the experiment to reformulate the HIV medicine ritonavir was executed without a hitch, it says. Varda has also started publishing the results of its internal R&amp;D efforts, including <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.cgd.3c01274">a scientific paper</a> on its hyper-gravity (as opposed to microgravity) crystallization platform, which the startup developed as a sort of screening method prior to sending drugs to space. [The paper is titled "Gravity as a Knob for Tuning Particle Size Distributions of Small Molecules."] It's an entirely new field of research that takes advantage of the ability to truly unlock gravity as a variable in scientific experiments. "Over time, we will be able to generate data sets between both hyper-gravity and microgravity and start to show correlations," he said.... <br><br><a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIUx5M8KDjU&amp;t=2634s">In a recent podcast appearance</a>, he specified that the all-in initial mission cost around $12 million, which will drop to $5-6 million by mission 4 and $2.5 million or less by mission 10.) Larger capsules are also in the longer-term pipeline, though also not until the 2027 time frame. Asparouhov also confirmed that pharmaceuticals will be Varda's sole focus for the next 10-20 (or more) years, based on the company's conviction that pharmaceutical products will generate more economic value compared to other materials. A lot of that comes down to the fact that there are a significant set of drugs that require only a "seed" of the material that can only be made in microgravity, and the rest of the drug formulation can be completed here on Earth...<br><br> The company is also aiming to improve the processing capabilities of the on-board pharmaceutical reactor. The first mission carried just one drug protein, but in the future the company hopes to process multiple drug products that could be run through different processing regimes. In the future, other missions could carry larger reactors for drugs that do need more than the "seed" crystal, and those mission profiles would be closer to something like mass manufacturing.</i><br> Varda already has "a handful" of signed contracts with biotech companies, according to the article — and Varda's next manufacturing mission "will launch later this year."</div></div></article><article id="fh-173470322" class="fhitem fhitem-story article usermode thumbs grid_24"><header><span class="topic"><a href="/index2.pl?fhfilter=nasa"><img src="/i/nasa_64.png&amp;output=webp&amp;q=80" title="NASA"></a></span><h2 class="story"><span class="s-title"><a href="/story/24/04/07/2238205/cnn-investigates-space-shuttle-columbia-the-final-flight">CNN Investigates 'Space Shuttle Columbia: The Final Flight'</a><span class="extlnk"><a class="s-sourcelnk" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2024/03/07/cnn-surveys-space-shuttle-columbia-the-final-flight-in-new-cnn-original-series/"> (cnn.com) </a></span></span><span class="comment-bubble"><a href="/story/24/04/07/2238205/cnn-investigates-space-shuttle-columbia-the-final-flight#comments">55</a></span></h2><div class="details"><span class="s-details"><span class="s-views"><span></span></span></span><span class="s-byline"> Posted by EditorDavid <time> on Sunday April 07, 2024 @08:54PM</time> from the <span class="dept-text">day-of-remembrance</span> dept. </span></div></header><div class="body"><div class="p"> CNN revisits <a href="/story/03/02/01/1442213/space-shuttle-columbia-breaks-up-over-texas">2003's disastrous landing</a> of the Space Shuttle Columbia tonight with two "immersive" specials co-produced by BBC and Mindhouse Productions "featuring exclusive interviews and revealing never-before-broadcast footage," <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2024/03/07/cnn-surveys-space-shuttle-columbia-the-final-flight-in-new-cnn-original-series/">according to an announcement</a> — with two <em>more</em> specials airing next week.<br><br> You can <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/vZWFPlMEP1I">watch a trailer here</a>. <i>Across four episodes, the story of the ticking-clock of Columbia's final mission is told in dramatic detail, beginning months before the troubled launch, unfolding across the sixteen days in orbit, and concluding with the investigation into the tragic loss of the seven astronauts' lives.

The Blueprint is the first sector-wide strategy for building decarbonization developed by the federal government... "America's building sector accounts for more than a third of the harmful emissions jeopardizing our air and health..." said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. "As part of a whole-of-government approach, the Department of Energy is outlining for the first time ever a comprehensive federal plan to reduce energy in our homes, schools, and workplaces — lowering utility bills and creating healthier communities while combating the climate crisis." <br><br> Buildings account for more than one third of domestic climate pollution and $370 billion in annual energy costs... The Blueprint projects reductions of 90% of total greenhouse gas emissions from the buildings sector, which will save consumers more than $100 billion in annual energy costs and avoid $17 billion in annual health costs. </i><br> Just for example, the Department of Energy's <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/affordable-home-energy-shot">Affordable Home Energy Shot</a> program "aims to reduce the upfront cost of upgrading a home by at least 50% and reduce energy bills by 20% within a decade." (Meanwhile, the federal government's role in making more change happen faster includes financing, funding R&amp;D on lower-cost technologies, expanding markets, and "supporting the development and implementation of emissions-reducing building codes and appliance standards.")<br><br> Besides the national blueprint, the Department also <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-better-buildings-initiative-accelerate-heat-pump-manufacturing-and-adoption">announced an expansion</a> of its <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/summit">Better Buildings Commercial Building Heat Pump Accelerator</a> initiative. In this program, "manufacturers will produce higher efficiency and life cycle cost-effective heat pump rooftop units and commercial organizations will evaluate and adopt next-generation heat pump technology."<br><br> U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said the program "builds on more than a decade of public-private partnerships to get cutting edge clean technologies from lab to market, helping to slash harmful carbon emissions throughout our economy." <i> On average, between 20% and 30% of the nation's energy is wasted, presenting a significant opportunity to increase energy efficiency. Through the Better Buildings Initiative, DOE partners with public and private sector stakeholders to pursue ambitious portfolio-wide energy, waste, water, and/or emissions reduction goals and publicly share solutions. By improving building design, materials, equipment, and operations, energy efficiency gains can be achieved across broad segments of the nation's economy.<br><br> The <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/commercial-building-heat-pump/accelerator">Accelerator initiative</a> was developed with commercial end users like Amazon, IKEA, and Target, and already includes manufacturers AAON, Carrier Global Corp., Lennox International, Rheem Manufacturing Co., Trane Technologies, and York International Corp. The Accelerator aims to bring more efficient, affordable next-generation heat pump rooftop units to market as soon as 2027 — which will slash both emissions and energy costs in half compared to natural gas-fueled heat pumps. If deployed at scale, they could save American businesses and commercial entities $5 billion on utility bills every year. </i></div></div></article><article id="fh-173470424" class="fhitem fhitem-story article usermode thumbs grid_24"><header><span class="topic"><a href="/index2.pl?fhfilter=fps"><img src="/i/fps_64.png&amp;output=webp&amp;q=80" title="First Person Shooters (Games)"></a></span><h2 class="story"><span class="s-title"><a href="/story/24/04/07/232257/warner-bros-issues-dmcas-after-suicide-squad-game-cracked-to-allow-playing-as-unreleased-characters">Warner Bros.
