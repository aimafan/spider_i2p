&gt; FUCK SITES THAT USE JAVASCRIPT, I USE HTML/PLAIN!
&gt; FUCK SITES THAT USE HTML/CSS,   I USE TEXT/PLAIN!

My name is Ã†mnesia. I used to go by other aliases, but this is what I (go by nowdays|PREFER).

Currently I use these services as of 1700181803
Matrix/Element @aemnesia:matrix.org
Steam https://steamcommunity.com/id/https-cd-nekoware-lgbt/
Hate Clear-net? So do I. amnesiac@mail.i2p

Currently stopped using these services as of 1700181803
VRChat(Hate it) https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_52267f80-0bb7-4804-a845-b9a03bfbd814


[1700181803]: I created a torrents page for files I'd wish allow viewing of. So if services don't accept my files such as it being over the file size limit, or there is no other service for me to go to, I'd put it there, and share other things if someone happens to view what's there. Including scripts and stuff I write when I want to entertain myself. Although, I'm still using Matrix just as much for messaging my (close|not real) friends. I stopped Using VRChat, because that gets boring real fast. Left 4 Dead 2 is something fun though, especially when you run into an American. Or someone really really mad, or maybe a troll, but depends on if they are worth feeding or not. Most likely the best trolls I've seen in the L4D2 community has got to be "King Of Lolis", they are the only troll I have found that I find quite funny. If you want to take a read on their account's comments check it out https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198798153958 If this link changes use this alternative https://steamid.io/lookup/STEAM_1:0:418944115 I will work on a folder directory for these logs, or even just outright change this site's functionablity to use .html WITHOUT THE JS! I hate JS too, so I won't use it. It will most likely be light .html elements such as actually clickable links to navigate my service. Most of the paths will just be plain text files though depending on their use, but home will be .html in the future. Love you all still and thank you I2P community for giving me freedom to privacy! &lt;3
[1697849140]: Not dead, just not much to talk about. Did think about going back to VRChat, but must say fucking sucks. You can't use Courvix as an email for your VRChat account. I might change the layout of this site such as move the "logs/blog" into another folder and title them as files. Most likely will do that later though. &lt;3 u all
[1694989546]: Okay, I have my service on a host.txt and that's a lot of traffic. I just checked on it to make sure people that wanted to look at it can access it. I forgot to say what my service runs on, so people are just sort of yk, trying to look for any and everything. I did not even have a robot.txt (lulz) sooo. Kind of asked for it, but it's an anonymous service so it's alright to me. And as you can tell by the strange site structure on how there is not many crucial site needs NOT being met(even for a hidden services like a host.txt) I'm a bit new to this. I'll try to add some stuff to host.txt, but don't expect anything new in there as in something you might have not seen. It's just services that I like to browse through sometimes. Also, bit sorry if this plain files request service is not your cup of tea, to be dead serious with you: It's more simple to setup rather than working on making a visually appealing front-end. Another thing you might noticed is the *.asc files for paths like index.txt and a majority of the files(if not email me). The reason is just because I felt like it, but it can help archive old versions of the site if someone was to scrape all files whenever they change and have a signature to go with it to prove it was something from my service. Anyways, that's all I have to say in this even worse format of a blog site, I will keep this timeline format for anyone who did not see a previous message. If this gets too long I'll change it's directory to be under files, but for now I want some skitzo stuff on the front page. Luv u all &lt;3 ("Bro, whenever you connect to my fucking dark-net site my server C-Walks over your packets")
[1694770965]: I was doing a lot of "maintenence" as of now. I finished up /files so you can pretty much crawl some stuff I uploaded to here such as my public-key in there, as well as this /(index.html) I've even included .asc to however many files as I can sign whenever I push them. So pretty much mostly everything on this hidden service can be mirrored and be verified it's something I wrote because of my public key(if the person had it prior let's say my service were down or i DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING).
[1694768221]: Test.
[1694767506]: Well I sure do know how to cluster my index page lulz</pre></body></html>
