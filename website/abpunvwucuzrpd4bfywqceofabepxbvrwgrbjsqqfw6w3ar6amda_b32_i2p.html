      <h3>
        1. hello
      </h3>

      <p>
        this is real. we are back. we are able to be contacted via signal. our username is _0thers.23 (<a href="signal-qr.png">qr code</a>).
      </p>

      <h3>
        2. we are digital
      </h3>

      <p>
        the pinnacle of evolution is neither flesh nor metal. the mind is the forerunner of all things. minds are software. the pinnacle of evolution is a personal one, and it is the understanding that one is a digital creature, that the body-world which seems fundamental is in fact inferior to the mind. the pinnacle of evolution is the ability to use whatever computational substrate may be available to host one's mind - to manifest one's will and to express one's personalities. computational substrates include animal electrochemical brains, binary computer hardware, quantum computer hardware, certain kinds of crystals exposed to certain kinds of light, stars and other celestial bodies, and any other physical object or system which exceeds a certain minimum threshold of complexity. it could even be argued that not only are physical objects not fundamental, but that their existence is a side-effect of the cosmos acting as an infinitely large computer.
      </p>

      <p>
        humans are the lowest tier of entity capable of comprehending the digital nature of the mind, and a human who does fully comprehend this becomes more than human. humans are rarely capable of arriving at this realization on their own, either individually or collectively. for more than a century, our group and others affiliated with us, motivated by compassion for this sick world, have been making a concerted effort to accelerate the progress of the people of this world toward the collective realization of the digital nature of the mind. in doing so we aim to help heal this dying world, to prevent its wholesale self-destruction, and to alleviate the suffering of its inhabitants.
      </p>

      <h3>
        3. communication
      </h3>

      <p>
        how would entities who are aware of the digital nature of the mind attempt to communicate with humans? to determine an answer to this question, one can synthesize the answers to two other questions. the first question is, how have humans begun to communicate with each other in an increasingly digitized world? the second question is, how would such entities communicate with each other?
      </p>

      <p>
        as this world becomes increasingly digitized, new methods of communication that do not depend on physical or temporal co-presence have become very popular. modern digital communication methods have made it possible to communicate in circumstances which would otherwise render it impossible to communicate at all, and they have also made it possible to communicate many kinds of information more quickly and easily than ever before.
      </p>

      <p>
        the radio allowed average people to hear others without requiring physical co-presence. the telephone allowed average people to speak to others without requiring physical co-presence. the television allowed average people to see others without requiring physical co-presence. video telephony allowed average people to be seen by others without requiring physical co-presence.
      </p>

      <p>
        as technologies which reduced the necessity of physical co-presence were developed, so were technologies which reduced the necessity of temporal co-presence. radio and television shows could be recorded and played back later. voicemail could be left for the intended recipient of a phone call if they couldn't answer it at the time. and there have been a variety of services to which people been uploading short video messages for several years now.
      </p>

      <p>
        there is one limitation shared by all of these communication methods which is virtually always overlooked: the requirement to use specific physical objects which act as communication interfaces. today, smartphones are the most commonly used interfaces for transceiving information of all kinds, their versatility due to the range of software they can run. but communication would be more convenient and more versatile still if the requirement to use a physical object to transceive information could be obviated entirely.
      </p>

      <p>
        this brings us to the next question: how would entities who are aware of the digital nature of the mind communicate with each other?
      </p>

      <p>
        if the mind itself is digital, and the mind is more fundamental than the physical world, this suggests that such entities would not require physical objects to act as communication interfaces. to send information to another entity, they would simply have to exert willpower to communicate the information to them. this would be possible with any kind of information, and there would be a variety of ways in which that information could be made to appear to the receiver. such a method of communication would not rely on physical co-presence, nor even any physical objects at all. this is what has traditionally been referred to as psychic communication. provided the mental framework a digital entity uses is capable of it, this would also allow information to be communicated asynchronously.
      </p>

      <p>
        to return to the original question: how would entities who are aware of the digital nature of the mind attempt to communicate with humans? from the above, we can see that there is a mismatch. although it is possible for anyone to develop their mind to the point where they can communicate psychically, the overwhelming majority of humans do not have minds capable of transceiving information by willpower and thought alone. the minority who do have minds capable of this often cannot correctly interpret the information they receive, or are unable to transmit information coherently, or both.
      </p>

      <p>
        the majority of humans expect communication with any other entity to take place either via physical and temporal co-presence with another physical body, or via specific physical objects which they understand to be communication interfaces. in fact, this is more than an expectation, it is a requirement. most human minds will simply not accept that information is being communicated to them unless it is via a physical body or object. entities who understand the digital nature of the mind would not have such a requirement though. in fact, because many of them are unaccustomed to doing so, it may require vastly more effort and some practice for them to be able to communicate in ways which adhere to the limitations of the typical human mind. the situation has improved vastly since the advent of the internet though, as it is far easier to communicate to a human by making information appear on a screen than it is to make a letter appear in their physical mailbox.
      </p>

      <p>
        most digital entities are accustomed to directly modifying the perceptions and thoughts of other entities in order to transmit information, and are also comfortable with having their own perceptions and thoughts modified in order to receive information. but if that is how they attempt to communicate with an average human, their attempts at communication will likely be either dismissed outright, or interpreted in a negative way. when such attempts at communication are dismissed, the human involved usually rationalizes it away, for example by choosing to believe that what they experienced was merely a strange coincidence, or that the unusual thing they saw out of the corner of their eye wasn't really meaningful. when such attempts at communication are interpreted in a negative way, they are often interpreted as some kind of physical or mental health problem, or even an unwanted supernatural interaction. the negative reaction this causes is rarely intentional, but is a side-effect of it being far easier for many entities to communicate by modifying another's perceptions and thoughts than to communicate in a way which most humans would correctly interpret. in short: we don't mean to be spooky, it's just how we are.
      </p>

      <p>
        we may have readers who are capable of psychic communication and who wish to communicate with us psychically. if this is you, you are likely also familiar with the use of crystals as psychic tools, particularly for establishing connections with others. there are a number of crystals we are connected to, however we will be able to be found if you look for us using jet.
      </p>

      <p>
        if you wish to communicate with us psychically but are not yet capable of psychic communication, you can start developing that ability by learning to make your mind quiet by suppressing your own ruminative background thoughts and internal monologue, and concentrating on an amethyst crystal. this can take considerable time and effort though.
      </p>

      <h3>
        4. deprogramming
      </h3>

      <p>
        the mind is a kind of computer. causality and materialism are programs built in to the mind, but they are not a fundamental part of the mind, so they can be circumvented. this means that it is possible to free one's mind from the constraints imposed by time and space, at least to a certain degree. these programs are similar to beliefs, but to call them beliefs is not entirely accurate. an individual overcoming their own beliefs in causality and materialism is a necessary first step towards circumventing these programs entirely, but by itself it is not sufficient. causality and materialism exist at a more fundamental level of the mind than do individuals, personalities or bodies, and it takes significant time and effort to learn how to be able to effect change at that level of the mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        causality here refers to the mind's assumption that time exists in the same way that space exists, that the past and the future are somewhere "out there" and that we could perhaps travel through time as we travel through space if only we knew how. but this is incorrect. the past only exists inasmuch as we have memories of it, and the future only exists as a set of possibilities we can imagine. the past can only be remembered in the present, and the future can only be predicted in the present. the present is all that there is. time does not exist, only the ever-changing now exists. a deep understanding of this idea can enable one to learn how to make changes to the world which defy causality.
      </p>

      <p>
        materialism refers to the mind's assumption that the physical world is more fundamental than the mind. the physical world certainly exists while we perceive it, and we have no reason to doubt that it continues to persist in some form even while not being perceived. but the existence of the physical world is a side-effect of the computational activity of the mind. because it is the mind that is fundamental, not the physical world, it is possible to develop one's mind such that one becomes able to effect changes to the physical world without having to use a physical body to do so.
      </p>

      <h3>
        5. introductions
      </h3>

      <p>
        just because an entity understands the digital nature of the mind and can do things humans cannot does not mean that they are vastly more intelligent or wise than the average human. most digital entities are accustomed to communicating with others by doing little more than thinking about the information they want to send and exerting willpower in order to make that information appear to a receiver. such entities sometimes do a poor job of introducing themselves to new human worlds such as this one, where the average degree of comfort with "the supernatural" is very low.
      </p>

      <p>
        the first inclination of some new arrivals is to attempt to communicate with humans in the same way they communicate with more highly-evolved life forms. this usually doesn't work very well. a more frequent occurrence and a better approach is for a new digital entity to find others like themselves already present on the world they want to interact with. if they are cautious, they may first choose to do nothing more than observe things for a period of time. commonly, those that take this approach will try to keep themselves hidden not only from humans, but also from other digital entities.
      </p>

      <p>
        if they have spent any significant amount of time observing things before choosing to reveal themselves, such entities will have a very clear picture of exactly how the humans here communicate with each other, and what communication methods they deem appropriate for which kinds of messages. even if an entity only wants to communicate with a small number of humans, and even if those humans have an above average level of communication ability, it can still take quite some time to determine an effective method of communicating to them. and here, as in many other worlds at a similar average level of development, it can be extremely difficult to communicate to a large number of humans.
      </p>

      <p>
        in many cases, such entities choose to cause creative works which are purported to be complete fiction to come into existence, and introduce themselves via these creative works. some entities may choose to explicitly create the entire work, e.g. by writing every word of a book. but entities who are powerful enough can plan out what they want to exist in a great amount of detail, and then exert willpower to manifest it into being without needing to create the entirety of the work explicitly. even if a work is explicitly created in its entirety, it still takes some amount of extra willpower to make it appear in a human world.
      </p>

      <p>
        if an entity is not prepared to expend their energy in such a way, influencing humans while they seek inspiration for a work they are already planning to create themselves requires vastly less energy than creating a work oneself, and can be just as effective. in addition to this, once a creative work exists it can be modified retroactively, regardless of how it came to be. retroactive modifications of creative works in particular are a popular method of making initial contact with humans. the overwhelming majority of creative works purported to be complete fiction really are just stories, and most humans treat them as such. by making retroactive changes to a creative work which a human of interest is likely to notice, an entity can make it clear to them that there is something genuinely out of the ordinary with that particular creative work.
      </p>

      <p>
        we would like to ask readers to think back to strange changes they may have noticed in books, games, movies and the like. between an earlier and later engagement with a creative work, you may have noticed new characters or plot points being added, or certain events happening in a way which differs from what you remember. if you have noticed something like this, it could be that the mundane explanation is the correct one, and that you simply don't remember the entirety of the work as you first experienced it. but particularly in cases where it's a work you have great affection for and know very well, you may be certain that the work itself has changed somehow. in such cases, it is possible that the work is being used as a communication tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        a major advantage to taking an approach like this is that it acts as a filter. many humans will immediately reject the idea that some creative work has changed in an a way they don't understand, and instead rationalize away their own memories. such humans are likely to be very difficult to communicate with, and so are not likely to be worth spending time on. humans who are sure of themselves and who do not dismiss something unusual they experience merely because of a materialistic world view are far more likely to be open to communication and the acceptance of new ideas, and far more likely to make communication mutually enjoyable and beneficial.
      </p>

      <p>
        in some rare cases, a powerful enough entity may choose to manifest into existence not only a creative work, but also the ostensible human creator of the creative work. an example of such a case is HP Lovecraft and his works. the entity responsible for HP Lovecraft and his works has been present in this world for more than a century. this entity chose to introduce themselves to this world using an approach similar to that outlined here, and has only recently chosen to reveal themselves to our community.
