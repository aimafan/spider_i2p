<p>EasyGPG is an easy-to-use GUI for GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) that uses Zenity and Xclip.</p>
<p>EasyGPG is released under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0. Feel free to hack away at it. See the notice at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p><a href="egpghelp.html">Here’s the help page for EasyGPG</a>. This is written to be understood even by those who barely understand what encryption is.</p>
<p><a href="egpgtechnical.html">Here’s a page</a> with more technical details about EasyGPG.</p>
<p>EasyGPG will do something useful with any file or folder you drop onto its Desktop file. All files created by GPG are handled as you would hope except for detached signatures. EasyGPG properly handles all keys and messages appearing in text, even if there are several.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Installing EasyGPG for the First Time</h2>
<p>When you click on the following link, you will be prompted either to save the file or open it with the appropriate software. If you save it, find where you saved it, and then double-click it.</p>
<p>In either case, extract the contents of the file, which will be a folder called <code>EasyGPG-Installer</code>. Open this folder, and double-click <code>Install EasyGPG</code>. The installer will download the latest version of EasyGPG, and then prompt for a location in which to save your new EasyGPG folder. By default, the new EasyGPG folder will be named <code>easygpg</code>, but you can use any name you like. You may have to refresh the folder to make the icons appear correctly.</p>
<p>When installation is complete, some windows will pop up. Read these, and you are on your way to using EasyGPG.</p>

<h2>Updating EasyGPG</h2>
<h3>Versions Earlier than 3.0</h3>
<p>Follow the instructions above, but select your already-existing EasyGPG folder. If you do this correctly, you will be asked whether or not you want to replace the existing EasyGPG. Click “Replace” to replace your old version of EasyGPG with the latest version.</p>
<p>In the <code>EasyGPG-Actions</code> folder, double-click <code>EasyGPG Help</code> to read about this new version.</p>
<h3>Versions 3.0 or Later</h3>
<p>If your present version is 3.0 or later, but earlier than 4.0, select “Check for a new version of EasyGPG” in the main menu. Otherwise, double-click <code>Check for a new version of EasyGPG</code> in the <code>EasyGPG-Actions</code> folder.</p>
<p>If the version you just updated to is not EasyGPG 4.58, update again.</p>
<p>You may have to refresh the folder to make the icons appear correctly after updating.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>
<h3>EasyGPG</h3>
<p>No “authorities” have ever communicated with me about EasyGPG.</p>
<p>When using software, the greatest threat to privacy and security is the Internet. EasyGPG will not attempt to communicate with the Internet unless you tell it to read text from the Internet or check for a new version. EasyGPG uses no “telemetry.” I will make no attempt to discover who is using my software, where, when, or for what purpose.</p>
<h3>This Website</h3>
<p>No “authorities” have ever communicated with me about the EasyGPG sites — neither the <code>.onion</code> site nor the <code>.i2p</code> site, and not the EasyGPG items on Codeberg and the Internet Archive, either.</p>
<p>No “web design software,” such as WordPress, is used to create my web pages. I create my sites using <code>asciidoc</code> with the HTML4 backend and some small shell scripts I have written.</p>
<p>My web pages contain no scripts. My sites use no analytics, nor do they set or read cookies. Neither do they use JSON web tokens, ETags, or web storage.</p>
<p>My sites have no server-side scripts or other forms of CGI software of any kind whatsoever.</p>
<p>All requests to the sites, other than GET and HEAD requests return an error. There is no way to send files or other information to my sites. Even URL query strings are useless. A “?” in a URL, and everything that follows it is completely ignored.</p>
<p>I want to be able to honestly say that I do not know how many different people or bots access this site, what software they use, nor who or where they might be. However, as noted below, I can, while I am at my desk, see what files are being requested.</p>
<p>If you are viewing this page on <a href="http://7hinc6ucgvwbcjjoe44lhzzxyjptb3da6tzl33oe7ezl2qgwlrkfe6yd.onion/">http://7hinc6ucgvwbcjjoe44lhzzxyjptb3da6tzl33oe7ezl2qgwlrkfe6yd.onion/</a> or <a href="http://easygpg2.i2p/">http://easygpg2.i2p/</a>, your request has been logged in a request log. All the entries in this log are erased at least once every 24 hours. This log is stored on a <code>tmpfs</code> file system, and is not backed up.</p>
<p>Each log entry includes only the following information: the local date and time, the HTTP status code, the request type, the “Host” header sent with the request, the document or directory requested, and the number of bytes returned to the requester. No other headers sent with the request are logged. Specifically, no “Useragent” or “Referer” headers sent with the request are logged. The IP address of the requester is not logged either. Because of the way Tor and I2P work, this is not possible. The only address the server sees is <code>127.0.0.1</code> (<code>localhost</code>).</p>
<p>Of course my request log is not shared with anyone else, and it is on a machine that no one else is allowed to log onto.</p>
<p>The only purpose of having a request log at all is to identify possible abuse: DoS attacks, etc. I have seen no such abuse so far, but I have seen much probing. Most of this probing generates 404 errors.</p>
<p>Whenever a request is sent to the <code>.onion</code> and <code>.i2p</code> sites, the following response headers are sent. <code>Date</code>, <code>Content-Length</code>, <code>Content-Type</code>, and <code>Last-Modified</code> headers will also be sent, though, of course, their values will not be the same for every request.</p>
<pre><code>X-Frame-Options: DENY
Permissions-Policy: accelerometer=(), camera=(), geolocation=(), gyroscope=(), magnetometer=(), microphone=(), payment=(), interest-cohort=()
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
