In today’s world of big-tech and mass surveillance, individuals that seek individual liberty need privacy. Governments accelerate the number of new laws, always adding more, it’s rare  to see laws taken off the books. The effect, essentially, results in the criminalization of everyday life. The mission of the Sovereign Project is: to empower individual sovereignty and push back against tyranny.
</p><p>
To remain free, individuals need camouflage to avoid the tyrants. In cyberspace, camouflage is provided via cryptography which can enable one to act anonymously. To act anonymously in cyberspace, personal identity will need to be hidden for safety reasons. Public key cryptography provides the ability to generate unique key pairs permissionlessly. An individual can present a public key as a digital identifier while keeping the private key hidden and safe. This provides for self-sovereign identifiers. Using public key cryptography, one can mathematically prove possession of the private key (of a public/private key pair) by presenting a digital signature that can be easily verified by anyone. Verifiable digital signatures allow individuals to mathematically prove digital identity for any authentication use case and that authentication can then be used in most any authorization use case. Key pairs can be used by humans as well as machines. So humans and machines can securely transact in cyberspace with their digital keys. Payments in cyberspace can be made with cryptocurrency and mathematical proof-of-payment can be provided via cryptocurrency protocol.
</p><p>
Physical and digital resources can be securely managed using public key cryptography. For example, a physical door with an electronic lock can be locked or unlocked through the use of a protocol that uses public key cryptography. Humans and machines that possess key pairs could be authorized to lock/unlock the door. When a human or machine desires access through the door, a request is made presenting the entity’s public key. The door receives the access request, then checks to see if that public key is authorized access to the door, if so, it then presents a challenge string to the entity requesting access and requires the entity to digitally sign the challenge string to gain access (if the public key is not authorized, an access denied message is presented to the requester). 
</p><p>
The requesting entity then digitally signs the challenge string and presents the digital signature to the door for verification. When the digital signature is verified (authentication successful), access to the door is granted. If the digital signature does not verify (authentication fails), then access is denied.
</p><p>
This pattern of authentication/authorization using public key cryptography can be used for access to any physical or digital resource and forms the basis of Sovereign Project Resource Management and Verifiable Credential technology.
