Hou’s fall to third place in some polls last week appears early, and it might still be recoverable. But grumbling in his party about replacing him has already begun. Indeed, all indications are that the party that twice gave us Lien Chan (連戰), the most despised politician in Taiwan, as a presidential candidate and later offered voters Hung Hsiu-chu (洪秀柱) and Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜), is arcing along its normal descending trajectory, the North Korean missile test of electoral politics. A KIND OF POLICY PLATFORM Last week the KMT doubled down on this path with Hou’s calls for nuclear power and more death penalty executions, standard KMT fare for decades (the latter is unnecessary since so many potential criminals are likely to die in traffic accidents long before they harm anyone). Apparently KMT policy institutions are not echo chambers so much as mausoleums where dead ideas are embalmed and then periodically put on display. The lack of public policy imagination is obvious. A less obvious facet of KMT ineptitude: with years of speculation that Hou would be their man in 2024, neither Hou nor the party insisted on interesting or experimental public policies to showcase Hou’s greatness in preparation for the showdown. Of course, that is even more true of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Hou’s slide and the media buzz surrounding it are obscuring the truly urgent problem the pro-Taiwan side faces: DPP presidential candidate William Lai (賴清德) has not expanded his voter support beyond the party base. In most polls he remains below 40 percent. Independent voters are staying away in droves, and for the moment the young are turning to</p></a></div></li><li><div class="thematics"><a href="/News/topic/taiwan+in+time"><h2 class="bfb">  taiwan in time <i><img src="/assets/images/right.png" width="10" class="iconimg2"></i></h2></a><a href="/News/feat/archives/2023/07/16/2003803245" class="onenews" data-desc="P:0:Taiwan in Time: Building shrines in changing times"><div class="bnewsimg"><img src="/images/2023/07/16/thumbs/p13-230716-anliang temple.jpg" width="100%"></div><h1 class="bfb2">Taiwan in Time: Building shrines in changing times</h1><p>July 17 to July 23 When Yeh Ken-chuang (葉根壯) came of age, the traditional skills of architecture and carpentry that had been in his family for four generations were disappearing. After helping his uncle Yeh Teh-ling (葉得令) construct ships, residences and temples for more than a decade, Yeh struck out on his own at the age of 28 in 1960 as a damusi (大木司, chief carpenter), earning his lifelong title “Chief Chuang” (壯司). Around this time, builders in his homeland of Penghu were increasingly using reinforced concrete instead of wood, due to the humid climate. The period also saw a frenzy in temple construction as the economy improved, meaning there was plenty of work for Yeh. Adept in non-structural techniques such as doors, windows and furniture, as well as the intricate carvings and detailed decorations that adorned the structures, Yeh was able to adapt his skills, leading the reconstruction of the historic Hsiliao Daitian Temple (西寮代天宮) on Penghu’s main island in 1963. According to the book Crossing Traditions in Yeh Ken-chuang’s Large-scale Carpentry Skills (宮廟巧藝 :跨越傳統的葉根壯大木作技術), it was Penghu’s first temple that used a purely reinforced concrete structure. Before his life was cut short, Yeh created more than 70 temples and related structures across the various islands of Penghu and left behind more than 230 building plans. Although Yeh could have built temples and other structures on Taiwan proper, he only worked on a handful of projects outside of Penghu because he wanted to be close to his family. CLAN OF CARPENTERS The Yeh family’s woodworking tradition began with Yeh Ma-li (葉媽利), who learned the architecture and carpentry trade from an unknown master on Kinmen. The Yehs trace their roots to Kinmen, although this branch had been living in Penghu since the early 1600s. Yeh Ma-li was Penghu’s chief temple builder between 1860 and</p></a></div></li></ul></div><div class="dbox5"><div class="dbox5s"><ul><li><div class="weather"><h1>Weather</h1><ul><li><div class="tablinks3 active" onclick="openCity(event, 'mygod01')">North</div></li><li><div class="tablinks3" onclick="openCity(event, 'mygod02')">Central</div></li><li><div class="tablinks3" onclick="openCity(event, 'mygod03')">South</div></li><li><div class="tablinks3" onclick="openCity(event, 'mygod04')">East</div></li><li><div class="tablinks3" onclick="openCity(event, 'mygod05')">Outlying Islands</div></li></ul><div class="tabcontent3" id="mygod01"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>New Taipei City</td><td>14-23</td><td>10%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Hsinchu County</td><td>14-22</td><td>10%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Hsinchu City</td><td>14-22</td><td>10%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Taipei City</td><td>14-22</td><td>10%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Miaoli County</td><td>12-22</td><td>10%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Taoyuan City</td><td>14-22</td><td>10%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Keelung City</td><td>15-21</td><td>10%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="tabcontent3" id="mygod02"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Yunlin County</td><td>14-24</td><td>0%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Taichung City</td><td>14-24</td><td>0%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Nantou County</td><td>14-24</td><td>0%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Changhua County</td><td>14-23</td><td>0%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="tabcontent3" id="mygod03"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Chiayi County</td><td>13-24</td><td>0%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Chiayi City</td><td>14-25</td><td>0%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Tainan City</td><td>15-22</td><td>0%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Kaohsiung City</td><td>17-23</td><td>0%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Pingtung County</td><td>16-25</td><td>0%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="tabcontent3" id="mygod04"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Yilan County</td><td>14-22</td><td>10%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Hualien County</td><td>16-22</td><td>10%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Taitung County</td><td>17-23</td><td>10%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="tabcontent3" id="mygod05"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>Kinmen County</td><td>11-18</td><td>0%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Penghu County</td><td>17-20</td><td>0%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr><tr><td>Lienchiang County</td><td>10-13</td><td>10%</td><td><img src="/assets/images/weather/wi_0002.gif" width="20"></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></li><li></li><li><div id="ad-B2" class="boxTitle ad pc web" data-desc="廣告ad-B2" style="text-align: center;
