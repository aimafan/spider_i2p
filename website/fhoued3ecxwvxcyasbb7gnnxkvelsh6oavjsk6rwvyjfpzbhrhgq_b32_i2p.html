With the proliferation of technology and the increasing amount of personal information available online, it's crucial that we protect our privacy and maintain our anonymity whenever possible.<br><br>One of the biggest reasons for this is the potential for identity theft. When our personal information is readily available online, it becomes much easier for criminals to access and use it for their own gain. This can lead to financial losses, ruined credit, and a host of other problems.<br><br>But the importance of privacy and anonymity extends beyond the realm of identity theft. In many cases, having the ability to remain anonymous online can be a matter of personal safety. For example, people who live in oppressive regimes may use anonymity to avoid persecution for their political beliefs. Others may use it to protect themselves from stalking or harassment.<br><br>In addition to protecting ourselves, maintaining anonymity can also be important for the greater good. Whistleblowers, for example, often need to remain anonymous in order to expose corruption or wrongdoing without fear of retribution. And in some cases, anonymity can even be a form of political protest, allowing people to speak out against injustice without fear of reprisal.<br><br>Of course, there are also those who would abuse anonymity for nefarious purposes, such as cyberbullying or spreading misinformation. But this doesn't negate the importance of privacy and anonymity in general. Instead, it highlights the need for responsible use of these tools.<br><br>In conclusion, privacy and anonymity are crucial for protecting ourselves and others in the digital age. Whether we're trying to prevent identity theft, safeguard our personal safety, or speak out against injustice, the ability to remain anonymous online is more important than ever.</p> </div> </div><hr><div class="card my-5 border-0"> <span class="imgbox"><img class="card-img-top mb-3 rounded-0" alt="Cover Image" src="/static/blog/img/uniqueid.webp"></span> <div class="card-body p-0"> <a class="text-dark" href="/linux-devices-have-a-unique-identifier-called-machine-id-here-is-how-to-change-it"><h2 class="title">Linux devices have a unique identifier called machine-id. Here is how to change it.</h2></a><h6 class="card-subtitle mt-1 mb-4 text-muted"><i class="bi bi-calendar"></i>September 24, 2022</h6><p> <strong>This was originally posted on our old blog, <a href="https://archive.ph/0OLMG">archived here</a>.</strong></p><p>What is a machine-id, and why should you randomize it? From the machine-id man pages, it is defined as:</p><blockquote><p>This ID uniquely identifies the host. It should be considered “confidential”, and must not be exposed in untrusted environments, in particular on the network. If a stable unique identifier that is tied to the machine is needed for some application, the machine ID or any part of it must not be used directly.</p><cite> <a href="https://archive.ph/o/0OLMG/https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/machine-id.5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/machine-id.5.html</a></cite></blockquote><p>In an effort to promote privacy, having a unique and unchanging identifier tied to your device seems like the wrong approach. It’s quite possible that poorly coded or even maliciously coded software could fetch this ID from your system. Let’s make sure that even if that does happen, that the value is constantly changing so that your device can not be uniquely identified as <em>your</em> device.</p><p>This is an incredibly simple and quick <em>adjustment</em> to your default Linux system. What we’re doing is showing you how to either adjust this value manually by hand, or by running a cronjob to change this value every minute with a new, randomized value. <strong></strong></p><p> <a href="/linux-devices-have-a-unique-identifier-called-machine-id-here-is-how-to-change-it">Read more</a> </p></div> </div><hr><div class="card my-5 border-0"> <span class="imgbox"><img class="card-img-top mb-3 rounded-0" alt="Cover Image" src="/static/blog/img/maintenance.webp"></span> <div class="card-body p-0"> <a class="text-dark" href="/service-impacting-update-maintenance-for-most-netherlands-vps-customers"><h2 class="title">Service Impacting Update / Maintenance for most Netherlands VPS customers.</h2></a><h6 class="card-subtitle mt-1 mb-4 text-muted"><i class="bi bi-calendar"></i>August 18, 2022</h6><p> <strong>This is an important notice that details some changes that will impact your service. Read below to learn about: Expected / planned downtime, IP address changes, more.</strong></p><hr><h4>What is happening?</h4><p>We are migrating all existing Netherlands VPSes to accommodate network changes.</p><h4>How will this impact my service?</h4><p>Each VM will be migrated to a new host node. This will cause temporary downtime during the migration process. Additionally, each VM will be assigned new IP addresses (both V4 and V6). We’ll be assigning customers IPs from newer subnets from our own ASN.</p><p>With the existing setup, we are using our own IPv4 and a <em> <u>leased</u></em> subnet of IPv6 which are announced under our upstream’s ASN instead of our own. This update will allow us to use our own IPv4, our own IPv6, and our own ASN. The geographic location, datacenter, network, features, hardware specs of host nodes, etc will all remain the same.</p><h4>I don’t want to change my IP, can I keep my current one?</h4><p>Unfortunately it is not possible to migrate these servers with the IPs intact. Sometime after this mass migration is completed, we can then re-announce the subnet that your IP comes from with this new network setup and then can re-assign whatever IP you had originally if needed, but this will be done by request only and only after all VMs have been migrated.</p><h4>Can you tell me what my new IP will be before you complete this change?</h4><p>Unfortunately this will not be known by us until after the migration for your individual VM has started. We do not have the option to choose what IP specifically will be assigned to your new VM. As soon as the VM is migrated, you will receive a new welcome email with your new IP.</p><h4>Why are you doing this?</h4><p>This is to better accommodate our growth as a business and to ensure public network information accurately depicts IncogNET as being the ISP behind our IP space. Additionally, this new setup will allow us to better accommodate our growth and to increase our presence in this location.</p><h4>When will this begin?</h4><p>We hope to start migrations <em>next week</em>. We’ll begin with some of our internal and personal servers to make sure our work flow for migrating customer servers is as optimized as possible.</p><h4>Where can I get additional updates?</h4><p>We’ll make updates available from the <a href="//portal.incognet.i2p/announcements">IncogNet client portal</a>. Wider, more general announcements will be posted on <a href="//natter.i2p/IncogNetLLC">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@incognet">Mastodon</a></p><hr><p> <strong>UPDATE:</strong>If you are on, "summer.nl.incogvps.com" then this does not apply to you.
