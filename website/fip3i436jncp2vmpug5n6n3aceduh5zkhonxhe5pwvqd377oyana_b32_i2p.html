Unfortunately, today's gravimeters are bulky, lack stability, or require extreme cooling. Now researchers have demonstrated a design for a small, highly sensitive gravimeter that operates stably at room temperature [1]. The device uses a small, levitated magnet whose equilibrium height is a sensitive probe of the local gravitational field. The researchers expect the design to be useful in field studies, such as the mapping of the distribution of underground materials.</p><p>Several obstacles have impeded the development of compact gravimeters, says Pu Huang of Nanjing University in China. Room-temperature devices generally use small mechanical oscillators, which offer excellent accuracy. However, they are made from materials that exhibit aging effects, so these gravimeters can lose accuracy over time. Much higher stability can be achieved with superconducting devices, but these require cryogenic conditions and so consume lots of power and are hard to use outdoors.</p><p>Superconducting systems have exceptional sensitivity partly because they use levitation—a small oscillating system is made to float in space and so remains free from many disturbances, such as vibrations, Huang says. He, along with Jiangfeng Du of Zhejiang University in China and their colleagues, wanted a design that would also employ levitation but without the cooling requirements of superconductivity or the need for materials that age.</p><p>Their new device is based on a magnetic-levitation concept developed more than two decades ago [2]. It involves two magnets—a large magnet, fixed in position, and a smaller, 200-mg test magnet located a few centimeters below, with field-repelling (diamagnetic) slabs of graphite positioned above and below the test magnet. The upward force supplied by the fixed magnet balances the weight of the test magnet, so it can levitate. The slight repulsion between the test magnet and the two graphite surfaces allows the magnet to oscillate stably in the vertical direction. The team adjusted the spacing between the surfaces to reduce this oscillation frequency to about 1 Hz. (The lower the frequency, the more sensitive the measurements can be.)</p></div></blockquote>  </div>  <input type="checkbox" id="more_24/04/07/0248236" class="story_more" autocomplete="off"> <label for="more_24/04/07/0248236" class="story_more">[Continues...]</label> <div class="story_more full"> <blockquote><div><p>[...] To test the device, Huang and colleagues used it to measure the tiny variations in the force of gravity caused by the apparent motion of the Sun and the Moon, the same variations that cause the tides. After setting up their device in a vacuum chamber, they waited several weeks for conditions inside the device to stabilize before conducting continuous measurements for five days. Their signal displayed a series of oscillations representing variations in the local gravitational acceleration of up to about 10−7 of the standard value (g, approximately 10 m/s2). The results show a close correspondence between the predicted gravitational variations and the experimental data. Overall, says Huang, the gravimeter demonstrated a sensitivity roughly 3 times better than small solid-state gravimeters, with much higher stability.</p></div></blockquote><p><b>Journal Reference:</b><br>Leng, Yingchun <em>et al.</em>, <b>Measurement of the Earth Tides with a Diamagnetic-Levitated Micro-Oscillator at Room Temperature</b>, <em>Phys.

However, sometimes these meteorological phenomena are hard to ignore. This was the case on 30 August 2022, when Gerona, north-eastern Spain, experienced a severe event in which individual hailstones reached a massive 12cm—the largest ever documented in the country. This led to serious damage to buildings, cars and agricultural areas, as well as 67 injuries and one fatality.</p><p>Untangling the cause of this unusually extreme hail event is at the heart of <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL107632">new research</a> published in <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i>. Professor Maria Luisa Martin, of Universidad de Valladolid, Spain, and colleagues investigated the role a record-breaking marine heat wave had in exacerbating the hail storm.</p><p>The Iberian Peninsula experienced a sea surface temperature increase of an average 3.27°C protracted over six weeks in the summer of 2022, the highest on record. The research team found that atmospheric convective energy reached unprecedented levels, thus alongside moisture from a warm ocean, enhanced supercell (storms with vertical rotation of rising air currents) development in the Pyrenees, leading to the meteorological phenomenon of hail.</p><p>To explore this further, the scientists used a dataset of &gt;280 documented supercells from 2011 to 2022 (with 57 citing large hailstones &gt;5cm diameter, and four giant hailstone events where they exceed 10cm diameter) to simulate the hail event both with and without the influence of a marine heat wave in the Mediterranean Sea. Increased sea surface temperature is known to be one of many consequences of global warming, and it has a direct impact on the frequency and intensity of prolonged (&gt;5 days) heat wave events.</p><p>[...] This research is important as it is a cautionary tale of how continued climate change will not only increase the likelihood of marine heat waves, but also other elements of Earth's interconnected cycles. Consequently, there may be more unforeseen meteorological events to come, with alarming environmental, social and economic impacts.</p><p><strong>More information:</strong> M. L.

But ensuring that they produce as much energy as possible is necessary if we're to rely on clean, sustainable energy production.</p><p>What commonly reduces the efficiency of wind turbines is induced drag, created as a result of lift. As a blade passes through the air, an area of lower air pressure is formed on top of it (the suction side). Higher-pressure air below the blade (the pressure side) seeks equilibrium with the lower-pressure area above, resulting in tip vortices, air that trails off the blade tips in spirals. The vortices deflect airflow downward (downwash), creating induced drag.</p><p>While most modern airplanes reduce induced drag by using winglets to minimize the effect of tip vortices, their use in the wind industry is still in its infancy. Studies into wind turbines with winglets have noted a boost in power production but often at the cost of extending the blade tip, making it difficult to ascertain whether the improvement is directly attributable to the winglet or an increase in the blade's wetted area, the area in contact with external airflow.</p><p>To clarify the issue, the U of A researchers turned to <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.biome-renewables.com/">Biome Renewables</a>, a Canadian industrial design firm that creates clean energy products by <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://newatlas.com/robotics/natural-robotics-contest/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;itm_medium=article-body">mimicking nature</a> and has designed winglets based on condor wings. Biome developed its bio-inspired winglet for 'Project Condor.' It's 17.6 ft (5.35 m) long and designed to be retrofitted to a wind turbine's blade wingtip after production.[...]</p><p>They found that adding the winglet increased the pressure difference between the suction surface and pressure surface along the blade's span, which in turn increased the turbine's torque (rotational force around an axis) and power production. The average increase in energy production was 10%, which the researchers concluded was attributable to the aerodynamic changes caused by the winglet and not just an increase in the blade's swept area.</p><p>"To sum up, the results of the wake study and the power production suggest that this bio-inspired design can increase the power output of the wind turbines," said the researchers.</p></div></blockquote><hr>  <p></p><p><small><a href="/submit.pl?op=viewsub&amp;subid=62478">Original Submission</a></small></p>  </div>         </div> </div>        <div class="storylinks"> <div> <ul>  <li class="more"> <a href="/article.pl?sid=24/04/04/1747216"><b>Read More...</b></a> </li>  <li class="comments"> <a href="/article.pl?sid=24/04/04/1747216#commentwrap">7</a> comments </li>  </ul> </div> </div>        <div class="article"> <span class="sd-info-block"> <span class="sd-key-sid">24/04/04/1743247</span> <span class="type">story</span>  </span>    <div class="generaltitle"> <div class="title"> <h3> <a href="/article.pl?sid=24/04/04/1743247">US And UK To Join Forces In AI Safety Testing</a>  </h3> </div> </div> <div class="details">  posted by  <a href="/~janrinok/">janrinok</a>  on Saturday April 06, @07:42PM  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/print.pl?sid=24/04/04/1743247"><img src="/images/print.gif" height="11" width="15" alt="Printer-friendly"></a>  <br>  </div> <div class="body">  <div class="topic">   <a href="/search.pl?tid=16"> <img src="/images/topics/topicsoftware.png" width="40" height="40" alt="Software" title="Software"> </a>   </div> <div class="intro">   <p>Arthur T Knackerbracket has processed the <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/ai-safety-testing-us-uk-partnership">following story</a>:</p><blockquote><div><p>The US and UK have agreed to work together to develop common testing approaches for AI models, with safety being a key focus.</p><p>The signed memorandum of understanding will see the AI safety institutes of the US and the UK work “seamlessly” with each other on research, safety evaluations and guidance for AI safety.
