<p>Welcome to www.BenTasker.co.uk the home of Ben Tasker!</p>
<p>I have a wide variety of interests including writing and photography, my main passion though is computing. 
Ultimately, I enjoy problem solving, whether through software development or when managing servers. The more 
complex the problem the happier I am, leading to a real feeling of ambivalence whenever I'm asked to investigate a 
compromised server - it's terrible news for the customer, but presents me with a new challenge to sink my teeth 
into. </p>
<p>I've a pretty broad range of skills, all built up through experience, but I decided quite a long time ago not to take my memory for granted. As a result, the predecessor to this site was 
born, largely as a documentation project, something I continue to add to regularly. If any of that documentation 
is of use to others, then that's great!</p>

<p>I've never been a <em>huge</em> fan of tapping posts out on a mobile screen, but there definitely are times when I feel a real need to get something out of my head and onto (virtual) paper.</p>
<p>Last year, I switched to using <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> to keep notes and draft posts. </p>
<p>On desktop, the move was <em>easy</em>. The mobile version of Obsidian did take a <em>little</em> more getting used to (the same functionality is there, it's just sometimes harder to find), but it's still preferable to anything else I've tried for this.</p>
<p>Initially, I used Nextcloud to keep my vault synced between my phone and desktop. Unfortunately, as I found when <a href="posts/blog/software-development/linking-a-bip3-smartwatch-with-gadgetbridge-to-write-stats-to-influxdb.html">playing with the gadgetbridge db</a>, Nextcloud's ability to sync a directory on newer versions of Android can be a little flakey.</p>
<p>As a result, I ended up in a split-brain situation, with my phone holding a version which simply didn't exist in Nextcloud (leaving me in a position where I was <strong>sure</strong> I'd updated a draft but it not being in my vault when I checked.... on desktop).</p>
<p>In this post, I'll talk a little about using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.lite">FolderSync</a> to have notes synced between Nextcloud and Android.</p>

<p>In December 2023, I <a href="posts/blog/software-development/adding-webmention-support-to-nikola.html">added support for webmentions</a> to my site. As part of the setup process, I also <a href="posts/blog/software-development/adding-webmention-support-to-nikola.html#webmention_silos">configured a backfeed</a> of mentions from external sources such as Github, Mastodon and Twitter - the idea being that if you comment on my content on social media, it'd show up as a comment under the relevant post (hopefully adding something of value for other readers).</p>
<p>At the time, I noted that I did have some qualms about the ethics of collecting mentions from other sources:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was reading a post by Terence Eden discussing <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2022/12/the-ethics-of-syndicating-comments-using-webmentions/">the ethics of syndicating comments using WebMentions</a> and found myself a little undecided on the question that Terence poses, at least as it applies to extracting comments from silos like Twitter</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Jumping back to the introduction to this post, this is where I feel a little conflicted about the ethical posture of collecting and syndicating mentions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I reasoned that it wasn't all that different in principle to users taking a screenshot of a social media post and sharing it elsewhere, hardly an uncommon occurrence.</p>
<p>Recently, my discomfort with the idea of pulling people's comments from Twitter/Mastodon/wherever and displaying them on my site was reignited after reading <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/mastodon-webmentions-and-privacy/">"Mastodon Webmentions and Privacy"</a> by Robb Knight.</p>
<p>Although privacy is a strong motivator, it's not the only concern that I have with having a webmention backfeed active, so I've decided to disable the collection and display of web mentions on my site.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll talk a little more about why I've chosen to do so.</p>

<p>I'm a fairly prolific note-taker and have been, in both my personal and professional lives, for years.</p>
<p>I manage my notes with <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> (in fact, even this post was drafted in it) putting its <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes">Daily Notes Plugin</a> into use to manage my to-do list. At the start of each day, the <a href="https://github.com/lumoe/obsidian-rollover-daily-todos">rollover daily todos</a> plugin copies any incomplete to-do's over from the previous day's notes.</p>
<p>This combination gives me a fresh notes file each day with any unfinished tasks copied across.</p>
<p>I've been using this system for quite a while, so there are now a <strong>lot</strong> of daily note files, which does make manually navigating to an older set of notes a <em>little</em> inconvenient.</p>
<p>Recently, I've developed a more regular need to look at the previous day's todo list: I've found that it's sometimes quite helpful to also be able to see what was <strong>completed</strong> in the previous day (as well as being useful for giving updates, it helps me avoid getting stuck in a rut where it <em>feels</em> like I'm not getting anything done).</p>
<p>Obsidian has template support which is able to insert the current date, but it's quite simple and cannot do date maths to work out what the filename of the previous notes file would be.</p>
<p>In this post, I'm going to write about the approach that I've taken to have Obsidian show me yesterdays work <strong>and</strong> display a link back to the relevant notes file.</p>

<p>When we first had solar installed, I really didn't envisage it leading to us switching to using electricity for heating over winter - after all, the sun doesn't shine very much, heaters are pretty energy hungry and mains gas was quite a bit cheaper than mains electricity.</p>
<p>However, my perception of the viability of using electricity to help heat the house shifted once we moved away from fixed rate tariffs and onto <a href="https://octopus.energy/smart/agile/">Octopus Agile</a>. Plus, of course,  using heaters to consume the free electricity delivered in a <a href="posts/blog/house-stuff/improving-the-energy-savings-delivered-by-our-solar-battery.html#power_ups">Octopus Powerups</a> really has been something of a no brainer.</p>
<p>In fact, having Solar probably doesn't <em>really</em> factor into it much at all. We switched to Agile because the battery allowed us to load shift, but it plays no real role in running electric heaters in the evening.</p>
<p>In this post, I'm going to write a little about the approach that we've taken this winter, along with some issues that we've encountered along the way.</p>

<p>The sofa in our living room, is actually only part of a sofa: it's the long side of a corner sofa.</p>
<p>When we originally bought the sofa, it was the perfect size and shape for our living room. Unfortunately, our landlord later did what landlords do and decided to switch letting agent on the sly, landing us with a section 21 no-fault eviction in the process.</p>
<p>At the next house, although the sofa could physically fit into the room, it <strong>absolutely dominated</strong> it.</p>
<p>Finally we moved to our current home, which has a layout that really can't accommodate a corner sofa at all. So, we unhooked the shorter side, leaving us with a straight sofa and an open-ended <em>sofa-bit</em>.</p>
<p>For a while, we had the sofa-bit on the opposite side of the room, but it never really worked particularly well: the seating cushions tended to find their way off the open end and move about under your arse as you get on and off the sofa. Not really needing that extra seating, we eventually moved the sofa-bit into storage instead.</p>
<p>For various reasons, we're taking in another dog. In preparation for this, I wanted to make sure that there'd be enough lounging space and so decided that the sofa-bit needed to come back out of storage.</p>
<p>Conscious of the cushion slipping issue and emboldened by my relative success at <a href="posts/blog/house-stuff/building-a-hard-pelmet-for-a-bay-window.html">making and upholstering a pelmet</a> I decided that I'd make a new end for the sofa.</p>
<p>This post describes that process.</p>

<p>I occassionally find that I want to cast a browser tab from my laptop - usually to put a chart onto a display so that I can periodically glance at it.</p>
<p>However, my laptop runs a fairly strict set of firewall rules - after all, it's a portable device and, on occasion, will connect to networks that aren't mine.</p>
<p>Strict firewall rules can prevent Chromecast discovery from working, mean that no devices will appear available to be casted to.</p>
<p>This post details adding rules to <code>iptables</code> to allow casting.</p>

<p>Over the past 9 months or so, I've written fairly extensively about how we've tried to <a href="posts/blog/house-stuff/improving-the-energy-savings-delivered-by-our-solar-battery.html">improve the savings</a> that our <a href="https://en.pylontech.com.cn/pro_detail.aspx?id=114&amp;cid=23">Pylontech US2000C solar battery</a> is able to yield.</p>
<p>Using the battery to <a href="posts/blog/house-stuff/charging-battery-from-the-grid-to-reduce-exposure-to-morning-peaks.html">shave pricing peaks</a> relies on schedules to control when the battery kicks in, ensuring that it supplies the house when prices are most likely to be high. </p>
<p>Getting that timing right is all the more important over winter, with the majority of savings being achieved by charging cheaply and discharging at peak rather than coming from the panels.</p>
<p>Recently, though, our savings attempts have been somewhat thwarted because the battery hasn't been kicking in when it's supposed to.</p>
<p>Over the course of January, I attempted to troubleshoot this whilst also engaging with our inverter's manufacturer.</p>
<p>This post details what we experienced, what was checked and how it was ultimately resolved.</p>

<p>Our dishwasher is about as simple as it's possible for an appliance to be: it's got a wheel to select a program and a push button that you hit to start the cycle.</p>
<p>I'm not <em>actually</em> sure how many years it's been in use (it came with the house), but it's still going strong and does what's needed of it.</p>
<p>The one small gripe that I've ever really had with it is the inability to turn it on remotely: it doesn't matter how cheap electricity is at 3am, I'm <strong>am not</strong> getting up just to turn the dishwasher on.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are a ton of "smart" dishwashers available on the market, each offering some part of a huge range of features including the ability to be switched on and off remotely. </p>
<p>The one thing that they <strong>all</strong> have in common, though, is increasing your exposure to the manufacturer:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the manufacturer decides to discontinue their IoT platform (or applies non-backwards compatible updates), those coveted smart features will stop working.</li>
<li>If the manufacturer changes their terms and conditions to something you don't find acceptable, your smart features will stop working.</li>
<li>If the manufacturer <strong>starts charging</strong> for access to their platform, you'll need to pay or your smart features will stop working.</li>
<li>The appliance (and the network it's connected to) may well also be exposed to the risk of compromise (as <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/security-vulnerability-lg-smartthinkq-turns-1-million-devices-digital-spies/">SmartThinkQ owners found out</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those feel like some fairly serious trade-offs considering that, amongst those offered by dishwashers, the only "smart" feature that I've really felt <em>any</em> need for is remote-start.</p>
<p>This post talks about implementing the ability to remote-start our existing dumb dishwasher (though it'll also work for any appliance with physical push buttons).</p>

<p>Over the course of the year I've published various posts looking at the <a href="categories/solar.html">performance of our solar install</a>, so as 2023 has now rolled over into 2024, it seemed worth posting a summary of performance across that year.</p>
<p>The system was installed at the end of May so we've not had a full year (and due to delays in the install, missed some absolutely cracking weekends), though we did get all of Summer.</p>
<p>Unlike my others, this post does not go into much depth - it simply looks at overall performance and a few trends across the year.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, I <a href="posts/blog/house-stuff/741-making-a-polished-concrete-table.html">made a polished concrete table</a> to use on our decking.</p>
<p>A family member really liked it, so has (quite regularly) reminded me that they'd like one if I was ever in the mood to create another.</p>
<p>This year, I decided that it'd make a good christmas present and so set about pouring a new table, changing my approach based on things that I learnt (or, thought that I'd learnt) last time.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll talk about the process that I followed to make this new table, what went wrong and what I've learnt this time around. </p>
<p>This post is a little unusual in that it was written as I progressed (and then scheduled for publishing <strong>after</strong> Christmas): Normally I write posts just after doing them, but given the timescales involved decided it would be better to try and write things down as I went.</p>
