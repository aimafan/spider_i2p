<p><b><font size="+2">THE STATUS OF THE GEEK CODE:</font></b> </p>
<p>The Geek Code is basicly a (small) part of Internet history.&nbsp; When 
I did the first incarnation of the code back in '93, it was as a lark.&nbsp; 
Eventually, it evolved into the form you see online now and has remained virtually
unchanged since that time. </p>
<p>I've always meant to, and still hope to, someday get back to the code and
release a new version for the new century that was more modern and hip and
all that.&nbsp; Several things happened.&nbsp; First, the internet of 1996
was still a wild untamed virgin paradise of geeks and eggheads unpopulated
by script kiddies, and the denizens of AOL.&nbsp; When things changed, I
seriously lost my way.&nbsp; I mean, all the "geek" that was the Internet
was gone and replaced by Xfiles buzzwords and politicians passing laws about
a technology they refused to comprehend.&nbsp; Think about it, this was the
infancy of even the world wide web, when having a "DotCom" address wasn't
hip (and wasn't a billion-dollar snowjob by the ICANN). </p>

<p>Still, I always said to myself "Self, some day you'll get over it and write
the new code." </p>
<p>AND SOME DAY I WILL! </p>
<p>However, until that time does arrive, The Geek Code stands as it does now,
still in the pure and pristine form it was intended.&nbsp; A testament to
the history of the Internet, however small a part it may have played. </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
