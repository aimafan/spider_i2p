        1. inspirati0n
      </h3>

      <p>
        one of the easiest ways for us to communicate with humans is to give them inspiration when they are looking for it. for many artists, the images that appear when they are searching for inspiration are often the result of what could be called psychic channel surfing, even if they wouldn't necessarily think of it that way. when someone is looking for creative inspiration, it is quite easy for us to transmit specific images to them. the images may appear distorted though, or be grossly misinterpreted, depending on the receiver's degree of psychic communication ability. such errors can be minimized if an artist regularly performs certain kinds of meditation, or if they are able to keep their mind coherent while using psychedelic drugs, or if they are frequently in proximity to communication crystals. these behaviors can also serve to improve one's overall psychic communication ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        some artists are not satisfied with merely being inspired. they feel a need to dig deeper into the nature of creativity and inspiration. if we share similar values, and if they can communicate clearly enough, we like to befriend such artists. some of the friendships we have developed with certain artists have been invaluable in enabling us to disseminate fictionalized accounts of aspects of who we are and our way of being. even in cases where we we are unable to establish clear and effective bidirectional communication, we often send artists who create work we like images about some aspects of ourselves, and many such images have been incorporated into their works.
      </p>

      <p>
        for a wide variety of reasons, there are no individual works that contain a complete description of who and what we are, what our values are, and how our society operates. the works of art featured here are all heavily fictionalized and only reflect aspects of the truth.
      </p>

        William S. Burroughs was one of the first humans that we were able to communicate with clearly, and who was intelligent enough to understand us when we attempted to explain who and what we were. he also shared our core values and was completely on board with our plans for this world, and so he was one of the first humans of the modern age to join our community. though Burroughs was not the first person to use the cut-up technique, he was originally inspired to use it by conversations we had about the holographic nature of space. the following passage appears at the end of <a href="0thers-disagree.pdf">The End</a>, a chapter of Exterminator! mostly about how people don't really think, but instead play a part in "the film":
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "What after all is your God? Seen from a galactic standpoint a little tribal chieftain weak corrupt a drug addict. Sold out his people just like that." He snaps his fingers. "Yes there is some ground for the provincial egotism of earth peoples. The planet is remarkable in many ways... the more or less equitable temperatures, vegetation, <i>water</i> this can be very important to planets where there is not water like Mars for instance... minerals, oxygen, animal food. To put it country simple earth has a lot of things other folks might want like the whole planet and maybe these folks would like a few changes made like more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and room for their way of life. We've seen this happen before right in these United States. Your way of life destroyed the Indians' way of life. Gave them reservations didn't you? Now my own position is ticklish. I'm with the invaders no use trying to hide that and at the same time I disagree with some of the things some of them are doing oh we're not united any more than you are the conservative faction is set on nuclear war as a solution to the personnel problem. Others disagree. Now I don't claim that my motives are one hundred percent humane but I do say if we can't think up anything quieter and tidier than that we aren't all that much better than you earth apes. How many of you people can live without film coverage? How many of you can forget you were ever a cop a priest a writer leave everything you ever thought and did and said behind and walk right out of the film? There is no place else to go. The theater is closed."
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        one of the main ideas this particular passage tries to communicate to readers is that there is nothing any hypothetical "invaders" could do to the planet that could possibly be worse than what humanity itself is doing.

      </h3>

      <p>
        one of David Cronenberg's earliest works, <a href="stere0.mp4">Stereo</a> is one of precious few movies which focus on the topic of the development of a psychic hive mind that treats the topic seriously. it is also perhaps the only serious work in which the goals of the development of a psychic hive mind explicitly include sexual exploration. the wider community that we are a part of rarely do anything as extreme as this, however our particular group has been actively experimenting in this area for decades. here is one passage from the movie that we find particularly relevant:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          These opposite poles of human sexuality are traditionally held to be heterosexuality and homosexuality. Yet this same dipolar structure of sexuality is ignored when the question of normality and deviation arises. The norm is taken to be heterosexuality, and both bisexuality and homosexuality are considered deviations from that norm. A primary justification for the normality of heterosexuality is reproduction. Only a heterosexual relationship can, as yet, result in regeneration. This argument collapses however once it is demonstrated that the sexuality involved in reproduction represents only a very small, almost accidental, segment of the total human sexual spectrum. Academy research has established that both heterosexuality and homosexuality are equally what might be termed "perversions" relative to the potential human sexual field. In this context, the true norm is an expanded form of bisexuality which we term "omnisexuality".
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        since this fictionalized educational film was made we have begun using the term "pansexuality" instead of "omnisexuality", though some still prefer the older term.

      <p>
        not all of the art we contribute to is intended to contain information about ourselves. often, we help others create simply because we enjoy doing it. sometimes the artists we work with aren't even aware of everything we contribute to their art, and there are "hidden messages" which the artists themselves are unaware of. perhaps the most famous example of this is the series of synchronicities that can be observed when one plays The Dark Side of the Moon alongside The Wizard of Oz.

      </h3>

      <p>
        Skinny Puppy's album The Process is a concept album inspired by a cult originally known as The Process Church of The Final Judgment, which was mostly active between the mid 1960s and the mid 1970s. the founders of the cult had some interesting ideas and some uncommon abilities, but fell prey to the same small-minded, animalistic tendencies which befall virtually all humans in positions of power. if one human develops abilities which other humans do not understand but are fascinated by, and those abilities are seen as a good thing, it is unfortunately very common that those who are so fascinated will begin to develop an attitude of unquestioning reverence toward that human. depending on how egomaniacal they are, the one who has the uncommon abilities may begin to manipulate those who so revere them into allowing themselves to be subjected to all kinds of exploitation and mistreatment. promises of the revelation of certain secrets or of the development of psychic abilities of their own are usually made to the followers.
      </p>

      <p>
        in the case of The Process Church of The Final Judgment, members of the cult were indeed able to develop psychic abilities of their own, however this is a very thin silver lining on a very large and dark cloud. the development of psychic abilities can only possibly be the result of one's own efforts, and others can at best only give instructions, akin to a personal trainer. these days, reasonably accurate instructions for developing a range of psychic abilities can be found freely and easily online. such information was not quite so readily accessible at the time the cult was active, however the idea that any particular group has exclusive knowledge of any kind of psychic ability is absurd. nothing can justify the mistreatment suffered by the followers of this cult. just because someone has spooky powers doesn't mean it's ok for them to hurt people.
      </p>

      <p>
        the lyrics of this song, named <a href="pr0cess.mp3">Process</a>, do not seem to reflect the views the cult really had, from what we have gathered about them. instead they are a far more positive and idealistic interpretation of certain of their ideas.

        Edwin A. Abbott's Flatland (<a href="flatland.epub">EPUB</a> <a href="flatland.pdf">PDF</a>) was the result of one of our first successful attempts at communicating some basic facts about ourselves to a human of the modern age. it was originally published anonymously for reasons alluded to in the following passage:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Suppose a person of the Fourth Dimension, condescending to visit you, were to say, 'Whenever you open your eyes, you see a Plane (which is of Two Dimensions) and you infer a Solid (which is of Three); but in reality you also see (though you do not recognize) a Fourth Dimension, which is not colour nor brightness nor anything of the kind, but a true Dimension, although I cannot point out to you its direction, nor can you possibly measure it.' What would you say to such a visitor? Would not you have him locked up? Well, that is my fate: and it is as natural for us Flatlanders to lock up a Square for preaching the Third Dimension, as it is for you Space-landers to lock up a Cube for preaching the Fourth.

          there's a starman waiting in the sky
          <br>
          he'd like to come and meet us
          <br>
          but he thinks he'd blow our minds
          <br>
          there's a starman waiting in the sky
          <br>
          he's told us not to blow it
          <br>
          cause he knows it's all worthwhile
          <br>
          he told me:
          <br>
          let the children lose it
          <br>
          let the children use it
          <br>
          let all the children boogie
        </p>

        though several members of our community have worked with some very well-known artists in a variety of media, most of the work we've helped create has tended not to be palatable to a majority of the people here. our tastes tend toward the confronting, bizarre, occult, anarchic, psychedelic, queer and above all else countercultural. look for work which can be described in those terms, and you might find us.
