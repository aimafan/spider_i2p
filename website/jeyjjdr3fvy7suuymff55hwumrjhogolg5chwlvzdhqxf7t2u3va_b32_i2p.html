<p>My name is Nook. This is my personal website where I show off my work, and the programming services I offer. An I2P business card of sorts.</p><img src="images/0.jpg">
			<h2>Programmer for hire</h2><p>I am looking for anonymous programming work paid in Monero. If you need a programmer then I might be right for you! My main area of expertise is systems programming with Rust. I have experience with:</p><ul>
				<li>HTML/CSS</li><li>x86 Assembly</li><li>Graphics programming using Vulkan/GLSL</li><li>Cryptographic theory</li></ul><p>Rates are negotiable but for basic one-off jobs a standard payment of <b class="cost">0.1XMR</b> seems reasonable. I would prefer jobs that are not illicit in nature, but please give me your offers if you have any, so I can have a look at them. You can have a look at some of my work here on this website.</p><p>You can contact me on <a href="http://polistern.i2p/">pbote</a>. This is a continuation of I2P-Bote, a now defunct project which implemented a high-latency mix network over I2P. Mix networks provide formal anonymity guarantees even against a global passive adversary. This is someone who is able to monitor the entire internet and would otherwise be able to find destinations and monitor traffic by simply watching messages go from hop to hop. Using pbote will ensure our communications stay highly secure albeit at the cost of significant added latency.</p><p id="addr">Address: b64.AQUFAgJb17zeBxb7OMiVTamRVpmKOFZNPyg3RUgVew64diWSUhKzAYvC2rh02fjUs71frUH51X7enXL8mYvDZVNEzc4J</p><h2>Portfolio</h2><p>To avoid deanonymising myself, I currently only have the source code and screenshots up for each of these, and you must build from source. At some point I would like to set up a safe reproducible build process though.</p><p>To build any of these, simply run make in the root directory of the source code. Some dependencies may be required.</p><p>This list is currently looking kind of empty, but for anonymity there is not a lot I am willing to share. Hopefully I can build this list up.</p><div id="grid">
