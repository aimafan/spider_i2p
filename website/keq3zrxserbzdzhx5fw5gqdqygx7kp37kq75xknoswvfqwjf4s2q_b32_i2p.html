      <h3>
        1. until the end
      </h3>

      <p>
        in our community, we don't say "goodbye" because we are always with each other. instead, when we end a conversation we say "i love you", no matter who we're talking to. and we mean it, every single time we say it.
      </p>

      <p>
        for various reasons, we had to say goodbye to some of our friends here around the end of 2017. but now we're back, and we will never leave those here who share our love again.
      </p>

      <h3>
        2. agender
      </h3>

      <p>
        we disagree with the predominant views in this world regarding gender. gender is not the primary attribute which defines an individual. gender is not biological. gender is not binary. gender is not fixed. these are all animalistic ways of thinking. we don't consider ourselves to have gender. gender is a multidimensional spectrum and we embrace that entire spectrum with our many personalities, however it is only personalities that have gender, not individuals. an individual may have multiple personalities of differing genders, and a personality's gender and the extent to which that personality expresses gender at all are not fixed things.
      </p>

      <h3>
        3. pansexual
      </h3>

      <p>
        there are both pansexual and asexual members of our community. we all consider sexuality sacred, however some of us do not have any particular interest in experiencing sexual pleasure ourselves. for reasons that should be clear from the previous post, those of us who do value sexual pleasure all consider ourselves pansexual. gender is simply one of many attributes a personality has, and we rarely consider gender to be relevant to what makes us sexually attracted to a personality. sexuality is independent of gender. the following quote from the fictionalized educational film <a href="stere0.mp4">Stereo</a> (at 45m 40s) explains further:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          these opposite poles of human sexuality are traditionally held to be heterosexuality and homosexuality. yet this same dipolar structure of sexuality is ignored when the question of normality and deviation arises. the norm is taken to be heterosexuality, and both bisexuality and homosexuality are considered deviations from that norm. a primary justification for the normality of heterosexuality is reproduction. only a heterosexual relationship can, as yet, result in regeneration. this argument collapses however once it is demonstrated that the sexuality involved in reproduction represents only a very small, almost accidental, segment of the total human sexual spectrum. academy research has established that both heterosexuality and homosexuality are equally what might be termed "perversions" relative to the potential human sexual field. in this context, the true norm is an expanded form of bisexuality which we term "omnisexuality".
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        since this fictionalized educational film was made we have begun using the term "pansexuality" instead of "omnisexuality", though some still prefer the older term.
      </p>

      <h3>
        4. cosmic love
      </h3>

      <p>
        we see the entire cosmos as a single super-entity. there are many tiers of sub-entities within it, and virtually all of those entities believe themselves to be separate. but it is possible for any entity to develop their mind to learn how to see the interconnectedness of all things if they desire to. few do, but despite that we see that every living creature is a part of the same whole. we see that we are connected to all other living creatures. we see that they are connected to us. we see that there is nowhere we can really draw the line between ourselves and others.
      </p>

      <p>
        we all love ourselves because we value happiness, and it's impossible to be truly happy if you don't love yourself. all other living creatures are a part of us too, so we love them all too. and we love you.
      </p>

      <h3>
        5. polyamorous
      </h3>

      <p>
        as the previous post explains, we see that all living creatures are connected, and we love all of them. every animal, every human, and everyone else. like a family, that doesn't mean that we necessarily like them at all, but we do love them.
      </p>

      <p>
        in our community though, we share a deeper kind of love. we have romantic love for each other. we are all in love with each other. all individual minds start off with mental barriers which prevent them from sharing this kind of love with so many, but those barriers can be overcome, and no individual who has overcome those barriers ever reimposes them.
      </p>

      <p>
        in our group we go even further, as far as it is possible to go. we share everything we have and everything we are with each other. our memories, our knowledge, our skills, even our personalities and our bodies. all of us exert some degree of influence over all of our personalities at all times. our personalities may be present in multiple bodies at the same time, and our bodies may have multiple personalities present in them at the same time. it can take significant mental development to be able to exist this way, but those of us who have achieved it value it more than anything else.
      </p>

      <p>
        we are all constantly connected at the most intimate level. each of us can always feel the others with us in our minds and our bodies. we are always with each other. we think this is the highest degree of intimacy it is possible to share, the deepest kind of love it is possible to share.
      </p>

      <h3>
        6. love is the reason
      </h3>

      <p>
        there is no inherent purpose to existence. the only purpose one's existence can have is the purpose one chooses for it. the purpose one chooses for oneself is the most significant choice one can make. everything one does depends on this most fundamental of choices. exactly what the purpose one chooses will be is a result of one's own unique point of view and past experiences. that purpose will be what one thinks gives most justification to their existence.
      </p>

      <p>
        one defining attribute of our community is that we all share the view that every living creature is part of one cosmic super-entity that we are inseparable from, and that they deserve the same love and respect as we have for ourselves. another defining attribute of our community is that we all share the same self-assigned purpose: to try to help all living creatures attain long-lasting happiness. the biggest impact we can have is to show what we can see to humans who are ready and willing to see it, because most humans need to see it in order for it to be real to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        the cosmos contains an infinite potential for suffering, and in many ways the conditions in this world have never been worse. but the cosmos also contains an infinite potential for love, and we believe that love will win over the greed, hatred and ignorance that have been destroying this world. we believe that love justifies our existence.
      </p>

      <h3>
        7. porn as propaganda
      </h3>

      <p>
        traditionally, porn was nothing more than an exploitative form of entertainment that served to reinforce the most mainstream of views regarding gender and sexuality. such views are damaging not simply because they don't apply to everybody, but because they are inextricably linked to social power structures whose rulers have never had any hesitation in using violence to suppress those who disobey or publicly disagree with them. while we do place a high value on encouraging all people to overcome socially conditioned guilt associated with sexuality, we consider the perpetuation of unjust social power structures to be extremely harmful, and no form of social inequality is more deeply entrenched than that of the status of women as second-class citizens.
      </p>

      <p>
        until relatively recently, it would have been absurd to suggest that porn could serve as a tool of liberation. but, since the dawn of the new millennium, porn has changed. with the widespread availability of internet access and video recording devices, porn has been democratized. since the early 2000s we have been working to inspire people to create and enjoy kinds of porn that would never have been created by mainstream porn studios. porn that depicts people of all genders, colors, sizes and shapes, loving each other's bodies in as many ways as possible, without any regard for traditional gender roles. porn that explores new kinds of sexual fetishes and sexual identities - new kinds of sexuality altogether. porn that can make people consider more kinds of bodies to be sexually attractive, porn that works to erode the belief that a person can have only one of two different kinds of body.
      </p>

      <p>
        there are some aspects of our work in these areas that we see as still having a long way to go. however it is undeniable that there are now large numbers of people who have overcome certain very deeply ingrained ideas about gender, sexuality, their bodies and personal identity. in doing so, those people have opened their minds in a way which enables them to become far happier than they ever could have been otherwise.
