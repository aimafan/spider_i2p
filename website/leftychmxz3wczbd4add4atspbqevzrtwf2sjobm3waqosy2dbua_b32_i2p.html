Voting functions as follows: Firstly you must join the matrix upon which you will enter a vetting room. The vetting is pretty much to make sure you are not a poltard and that you follow some tenant of socialism, nothing more.<br><br>After you are vetted you will be added to the chat, the voting hall and the congress respectively. Any anon may make any proposal at any time<br>In order for a proposal to become a vote, firstly, a proposal must be created (duh); simply make a post in the votting hall declaring your proposal.<br>A proposal must receive two thumbs up by two other congress members other than the person who drafted the proposal.  <br><br>After you get two thumbs up you, or any other congress member, may open up a vote by declaring that it is a vote, a short summary of what the vote is over, and a date and a time for when the vote will conclude.<br>In order for a vote to pass there must be a civil majority (no ties) from the time the vote opens to the time the vote closes. Votes close, nominally after 3 days from the time they are start, but, if a majority of 6 or more anons over overwhelmingly support the proposal then the vote can be fast tracked to 24 hours upon such a threshold being reached. One last thing: A vote that is deemed critical cannot be fast tracked.<br>The numbers required for a proposal to become a vote and fast tracking are subject to change as the congress grows, fyi.<br><br>That's really all there is too it. As I stated in the news post I implore any current users to join the congress who already haven't and give feed back and cast your vote you are entitled too/make proposals etc etc."</p><h2 id="84">Greetings all!<span class="unimportant"> — by  at 2022-03-20 (Sun) 04:09:59</span></h2><p>We would like to take time out to give ourselves a pat on the back for all the hard word we have been doing in the last 5 or so months and talk about our accomplishments so that we may hopefully give out take on the story at hand and give ourselves a chance to talk about our development on leftychan:<br><br><br>Firstly, Consistent TOR use (never turned off because of one prick or because the mods feel like it) We leave tor running 24/7 you also are always allowed to post images, always. This will never change.<br><br>-Consistent and fair moderation coupled with a user democracy that allows the userbase themselves to Reprimand and appoint mods as they really see fit.<br><br>-Pleroma instance; Pleroma is kind of like an open source twitter clone that has a high character limit starting by default at 5000.<br><br>-Text boards; We are very proud of our textboard and we think that a textboard more suits the ideals and aims of Marxists and communists in general considering all we do is really read.<br><br>-Matrix: leftychan hosts its own Matrix server located @ matrix.leftychan.net on its own hardware. Matrix is a free and open source alternative to discord where you won't be banned for saying something unfavorable, or, in this case, disagreeing with mods and can vote on the site's direction via our user democracy which is hosted on our server. If the mods make a change you don't like you can vote to remove that change, and if they haven't done something you want you can vote to have the mods do that thing;<br><br>-The voting process itself. The voting process at .net is not like orgs in that only a select handpicked group of elitists get to cast a vote and make decisions. You yourself any person (as long as they are not some poltard) are allowed to make decisions and cast votes on matters of the website<br><br>-Discord: The discord creation was voted on by civil majority in the early days of the site and has been rather successful. If you want to use it the door is always open and the link is posted on the announcements, though, we high encourage using matrix (which is also found in the announcements section) over our discord because Matrix is superior for reasons mentioned above; FOSS.<br><br>-Mumble instance; Mumble is a free and open source VIOP client that we have set up just recently that we would enjoy seeing any anons come and us with us! mumble://leftychan.net ; mumble.leftychan.net ; leftychan.net - In your mumble client. <br><br>We have also been fairly consistent with our news updates and updating the general board with the on goings of the matrix votes on the board.<br><br>This and many other reasons is why we would implore you to use our site, especially, over .org where the mods make all the decisions unilaterally with out actually listening or caring about their user base what so ever. They can pay lip-service, but, do they really? No if they did they would simply have a system more akin to what we currently have here at leftychan. They simply care about retaining their power and it shows through their inconsistent moderation and lack of available features.<br><br>Regards - The team.</p><h2 id="80">777 change to /doom/ from /R9K/<span class="unimportant"> — by  at 2022-02-19 (Sat) 16:26:06</span></h2><p>We have moved many of the page 1 threads to /b/ from /777/ - Formerly R9K. We understand the board is popular, however, a vote to add the board has failed in the matrix. This is a bit of a contentious issue as we have never actually voted on adding boards before and will take more discussion. We will return to the question of adding R9K as a permanent fixture in a months time par the course of revisiting on votes and subject matter such as this.<br><br>/777/ Has been changed to /doom/ a doomer board for doomer people and other nihilistic outlooks and takes about the current state of the world. - Enjoy!</p><h2 id="79">Welcome sticky removed <span class="unimportant"> — by  at 2022-01-08 (Sat) 18:58:25</span></h2><p>In a 4 - 1 vote the decision to remove the welcome sticky from /leftypol/ has been finalized.

Users on the discord are still under the dictatorial control of the staff, however.  <br>Wsws posts will now be on a delete and removal on sight type of moderation. The vote passed nearly unanimously. All wsws spammer does it post and run and doesn't actually contribute anything to the board and his posts have been deemed spam.</p><h2 id="74">Default theme change to Yotsuba<span class="unimportant"> — by  at 2021-09-05 (Sun) 19:33:33</span></h2><p>The default theme is set to be changed to Yotsuba. The changes are made and ready to be pulled. Expect it to be coming down the line very soon.<br>/Music/ has been changed to /ent/ which is to be used for general entertainment, tv shows, music, movies, etc etc etc. Hobby is going to also be merged into /ent/ as to reduce redundant or unnecessary boards.<br>Last but not least we are going to rename roulette to /777/.<br><br>That should be about all for now, thanks`</p><h2 id="73">Vote for /i/ to pass<span class="unimportant"> — by  at 2021-09-03 (Fri) 05:42:54</span></h2><p>A vote has been held on the creation of a /i/ board. The vote to add a /i/nvasion board is prompted to pass with an over whelming majority.<br>Further we will be creating a sticky in meta specifically for discussion of the votes being held in the congress.<br>A vote has been passed as well to attempt, again, to reach out to the org and establish some type of mutual agreement.<br><br>To be clear: Both the /i/ vote and the vote to attempt to open up communications with org have passed with an over whelming majority. I urge more people to join the matrix if you are posting on the board so you can add your input and opinion on happenings for the site.<br><br>Last but not least we will be merging hobby and music into one /media/, or, /ent/ertainment board. That's about all we have for now, thanks.</p><h2 id="70">Character limit fix'd<span class="unimportant"> — by  at 2021-08-29 (Sun) 15:08:52</span></h2><p>The character limit has been lowered to 100.<br><br>/music/ will be changed to /media/ to encompass all forms of entertainment.
