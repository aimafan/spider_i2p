Among them, solar energy has the advantage of being available everywhere on Earth, with low dependence on natural topography. However, fluctuations in solar output and generation due to factors such as season and weather lead to repetitive increases and decreases in power, posing a challenge of damaging components of production devices. Therefore, precise evaluation of the durability of devices under power fluctuations is crucial for determining the optimal timing for component replacement and developing new materials.</div></section><section class="tagged"><div class="date">1:22 PM, Monday April 8th 2024 UTC</div><header><img src="/img/techxplore.svg"><h2><a target="_blank" href="//techxplore.i2p/news/2024-04-3d-printer-figure-unknown-material.html">This 3D printer can figure out how to print with an unknown material</a></h2><div class="tags"><span>Engineering</span></div></header><div class="description">While 3D printing has exploded in popularity, many of the plastic materials these printers use to create objects cannot be easily recycled.
