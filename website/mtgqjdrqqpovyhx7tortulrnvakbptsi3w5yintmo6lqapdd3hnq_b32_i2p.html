I started working on my master's degree last September. The goal was to return to my workplace as a domain expert in formal methods – a topic I knew I was interested in, and yet something I knew practically nothing about. I partially attribute my lack of exposure to the lack of supervised learning opportunities (courses) at my undergraduate institution. Brown has an ample supply of teaching and research faculty who work in the field, though, so  I've been taking advantage of that and soaking up as much knowledge as I can. I'm writing this to summarize what I've learned and done through my few months at grad school, and also to touch on what I have yet to learn because, as it turns out, three semesters is not nearly enough time to become a "domain expert" in anything. A beginning practitioner, perhaps, but I'm sure even that's an overly-generous characterization.

When I started writing this article, I didn't mean to do anything more than describe a comment system I'd written in Guile. But as often happens when I write, I soon found myself disregarding that original scope and  recording the history of every line of code I've written that's ever been run by a web server. I settled on allowing this to be an article about incorporating dynamic content into a <a href="https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html">Haunt</a> site – a use-case that Haunt probably wasn't built to support, but which works surprisingly well due to Haunt configurations being ordinary Scheme programs.

For the past ten months, I've been using my <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">PinePhone</a> as a "daily driver." By
which, I mean it's been in my pocket everywhere I go, and it's the device I use
to make phone calls. Depending on your familiarity with the PinePhone (or the
state of "Linux Phones" more generally) this statement is either delirious, or
vapid (why should I care that you use a "smart" phone just like the rest of us?)
Don't be mistaken: the PinePhone is usable as a little cellular-capable PDA, and
it's in a league of its own. This article is my attempt to document my
experiences and rationale for wanting to use one, as well as my thoughts on
mobile Linux in general.

My <a href="https://flipperzero.one/">Flipper Zero</a> arrived in the mail a few weeks ago, ending a nearly two-year
wait for its arrival. For the uninitiated, it's a "multi-tool device for geeks":
a development board for radio, IR, and GPIO in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi">Tamagotchi</a>-like form-factor. It
combines the capability of the <a href="https://kk4vcz.com/goodwatch/">GoodWatch</a> with the cuteness of the <a href="https://pwnagotchi.ai/">Pwnagotchi</a>.
Part of the appeal, to me, is the ability to hack on the <a href="https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware">free (as in freedom)
firmware</a>. As capable as it was out of the box, providing plenty of amusement
when my brother and I took it for a spin through some parking garages, there are
still features I'd like to add to it. The problem is that I've been too pampered
by Rust as of late to want to do my firmware hacks in C.

Last night – Thursday, May 12th, 2022, at 22:17L – my cat was put to rest. I
tend to avoid publishing anything non-technical to this website, but she
deserves to be remembered, and this is the only place I can be confident my
writing will last. She'd been with me through most of my life, always bringing
me comfort when I was stressed, and keeping watch over me when I was sick. I owe
this to her.

It's that time of year again where I take some time to reflect on <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1561">UMass CTF</a>.
This is going to be shorter than last year's. I put out eight challenges, and
I'm only going to be writing about one of them. Code, documentation, and
write-ups for the others are available <a href="https://github.com/UMassCybersecurity/UMassCTF-2022-challenges">here</a>.

The background for this project is a lesson in avoiding dishonest vendors. Two
years ago, I was looking to purchase a smart watch with sleep tracking
capabilities; I've always had difficulty sleeping and wanted a way of
finally quantifying that difficulty. One of my requirements was the ability to
pull data off of the watch without the use of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/">proprietary software</a>, so the only
options I was seriously considering were those on <a href="https://gadgetbridge.org/">Gadgetbridge</a>'s "supported
devices" list. At the time, I was still in high school, and still awed by the
affordability of consumer electronics on websites such as AliExpress (woefully
unaware of the <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2019/11/20/China.html">ethical implications</a> of supporting a totalitarian state's
economy). Moreover, I was somewhat capable of reading and writing 汉语, so the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi_Mi_Band_2">Xiaomi Mi Band 2</a> fit the bill. I took to Ebay to purchase one, finding a listing
for 10.99 USD with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/08/23/641140144/unraveling-the-mystery-behind-international-shipping-rates">free shipping</a>. I ordered it, and things were okay. That is,
until the package arrived.

This was the first year our capture-the-flag event, <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1282">UMass CTF 2021</a>, was open to
the public. The competition started Friday, March 26th at 18:00 EDT, and ended
Sunday, March 8th at the same time. By the end of the competition, we had <b>1991
registered users</b>, belonging to <b>1160 registered teams</b>. No teams were tied, we had
just one unsolved challenge, and each of the "harder" challenges had just one or
two solves.

Well, this is certainly overdue. It's the writeup for a challenge I authored for
this year's UMass CTF, which ran from <i>October 5th to October 12th</i>. Yes, I'm
late. But when you attend a university that tried very hard to squeeze the
<a href="https://www.umass.edu/coronavirus/news/umass-amherst-announces-fall-2020-reopening-plan-under-extensive-public-health-and-behavioral">entire semester twelve weeks</a>, you're going to deal with burnout and not nearly
enough time to do things outside of your coursework. So I'm finally coming back
to the challenge now that the semester's ended.

This is a post I've been meaning to write for a while now: one anecdotally
comparing programming languages in the Lisp family. I consider myself to be a
Lisp hacker. Perhaps that much was obvious from the letter λ adorning my
website's header, a reference to the λ-calculus which inspired John McCarthy to
design the first LISP [1]. Yet, "Lisp hacker" likely means little unless you,
too, consider yourself to be a Lisp hacker. Calling yourself one seems carry
some level of unstated meaning. Indeed, some identify with more specific groups.
"Schemer," or "Guiler," or "Racketeer," or "Clojurist." But "Lisp Hackers" ⊇
"Schemers". There is commonality shared among all, or at least most, of these
programming languages, and the Lisp hackers recognize and appreciate that
commonality – the characteristics that make a programming language a Lisp.
Homoiconic syntax, powerful metaprogramming facilities, and editor support that,
in my opinion, is unparalleled. (Yes, I am alluding to GNU Emacs.) This article,
however, is concerned with the differences. In it, I will be considering the
specifics of each dialect, and whether or not those specifics make for a
language I would want to use to develop a new piece of software.
