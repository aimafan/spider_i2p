			a <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US">Google</a> Product (Android, Google Home)?
			Do you shop at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496&amp;ref_=footer_privacy">Amazon</a> or use Alexa Products like Echo?
			Or use any of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/">Meta's</a> Apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger)? I have linked each of their privacy policy
			to allow you to click on them. When I tell you what data they store on you, you can verify by using Ctrl+F (Or your keybind for your find on your browser).
			These companies have in common the following policies:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					They keep data pertaining to your usage of their product. This can be benign, like crash information. however, it can be extremely intrusive,
					Like how Google collects your activity, like "People with whom you communicate or share content" and "Voice and Audio Information."
				</li>
				<li>
					They keep metadata, data that is under the hood from the average user. This includes IP Addresses, Carrier information for mobile products,
					System activities, Date &amp; Time, and in some fashion "Unique Identifiers" (From Google: IEMI-number of a mobile device).
				</li>
				<li>
					They share data with your third parties, granted some are more restrictive than others.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I go much deeper in my <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> on the issues most of these major tech companies do with your data</p>

			<p>
			I would like to state to any new visitors, that you are under a <a href"https:="" wikiless.tiekoetter.com="" wiki="" global_surveillance"="">global surveillance</a>.
			It started with <a href="https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/UKUSA_Agreement">Five Countries</a>: United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada &amp;
			New Zealand. It extended to <a href="https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/Five_Eyes?lang=en#Nine_Eyes">Nine Countries</a>: Denmark, France, the
			Netherlands and Norway And now its even further extended to <a href="https://securitymadesimple.org/cybersecurity-blog/fourteen-eyes-surveillance-explained/">
			Fourteen Countries</a>: Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain &amp; Sweden. Worse yet, there are countries that are affiliated: Israel, Japan, South Korea,
			Singapore &amp; British Overseas territories (Like British Virgin Islands).
			</p>

			<p>
			How does all of this add up? Read up on the <a href="https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/PRISM">PRISM</a> program. Companies like Google &amp; Apple have
			given up user data to the government, which this could include you! The New York Times
			<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/technology/personal-data-apple-google-facebook.html">Reported</a> that The Justice Department used a court order
			to seek email logs from Google, Call records &amp; other data from Apple and Microsoft about certain congressmen, and Facebook turning over private
			information (messages, photos, videos post &amp; location data). In essence, <b>In the view of these government bodies, <u>YOU ARE A CRIMINAL</u>!</b>
			Don't believe me? Take a look at these
			<a href="https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/List_of_people_under_surveillance_by_Anglospheric_intelligence_agencies?lang=en">People that were surveiled</a>
			and look into each of their profiles. For the sake of argument, lets say some people may have deserve it.
			However, people like <a href="https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/Kim_Dotcom?lang=en#Political_fallout">Kim Dotcom</a> and
			<a href="https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/John_Lennon?lang=en#FBI_surveillance_and_declassified_documents">John Lennon</a> were included in this
			surveilance. You might be able to make excuses for Kim, but John Lennon was absolutely innocent in his activism, whether you think his music is good or not.
			</p>

			<p>
			Now, Things don't just stop with surveillance. Companies like Google, Apple, &amp; Microsoft is trying to make a cultural shift that would ultimately damage
			the ability to live in a free society. Apple, being the best of the worst, designed their products to work only with their other products. This creates a
			tight control on what the user can do, as any violation to one product or service will be a violation to your whole apple account. However, it isn't as bad
			as Microsoft's push on the enforcement of the
			<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/hardware-security/tpm/trusted-platform-module-overview">TPM 2.0 Modules</a>.
			This means that every user has a completely unique identifier for their device, and it is being masqueraded as a privacy feature. They're arent lying that
			RSA key helps improves the privacy of your data, <u>but RSA aids in confidentiality, that actions goes towards the intended party and nobody else</u>.
			Lastly, Google has been caught interfering with countries election, <b>Including the United States</b>!
			<a href="https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/Robert_Epstein">Robert Epstein</a> has done so much data collection on google's actions &amp; ephemeral data,
			he saw that <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/opinion/how-google-stopped-the-red-wave-4859553">[CF] Google Sends less "Go Vote" reminders to 
			Republicans</a>. There is so much he has done, I would highly suggest just looking into him if this is something you find concerning. I found him
			through <a href="https://rumble.com/v3n0rk1-how-google-manipulated-elections.html">Steven Crowder's Daily Show (via Gerald)</a> and saw him again on
			<a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=XgpIHS0HUbg&amp;list=PLxQaod7tWvYJ9CMURLNelX-52XP2CB7iH&amp;index=2">Tim Pool's Culture War Podcast</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
			Now, If you have looked into any of the surveillance links I posted, you would have noticed that this has been going on for a very long time. Because
			of this, there were companies taking advantage of the "privacy crisis". Duck Duck Go
			is a "privacy search engine" with claims that they don't track you. In fact, they even once stated
			<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190813104119/https://spreadprivacy.com/data-anonymization/">"The only truly anonymized data is no data"</a>.
			Yet, they "protect your search history from everyone" by "throw[ing] out personal information every time you search". The main issue, is
			<b>code words, interests, &amp; your typing style can identify you!</b>. With that said, they admit they will comply with court ordered legal requests.
			This isnt as bad as Mozilla. My Introduction is <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/the-removal-of-the-dissenter-extention/38140">
			Mozilla Banning the Dissenter Addon</a>, and lead to <a href="https://digdeeper.club/articles/mozilla.xhtml">This Article</a> from Dig Deeper. To really
			add to this problem, Cloudflare is one of the biggest offenders. Their service that "protect's websites" is the literal definition of a
			"Man in the Middle" service. Unless the viewer know how to analyze this, they wouldn't even know that you're talking to a cloudflare server.
			They stand in the way of people using VPNs, TOR &amp; Javascript-free users by blocking access to the services or preferences. Worse yet,
			<a href="https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/Cloudflare#Service_terminations">They Ban Websites</a> based on <b>THEIR</b> morality. Overall, Cloudflare
			has become a plague on the internet, with about 20% of the internet using them for their web security while forcing viewers out of TOR/VPN and using
			Javascript. <i>There is more to say, like VPNs, Chat applications, Operating Systems, and more, but this section will go on forever. This will deserve
			its own article to explain every service types</i>.
			</p>

			<p>
			What is "my" solution? To be honest, I understand the <a href="https://digdeeper.club/articles/botnet.xhtml">black pill</a> that the only
			to fix this is to fight on the physical level. In all respect, I highly disagree on the conclusion, but I also have a separate perspective on this.
			<b>If you're going to fight for your internet freedom, there will never be "peace".</b> This means that the fight will continue on, between the
			surveillance groups and the (real) freedom fighters. This principle is an American principle: in order to maintain your freedom, you must fight for your
			freedom. the moment you become complacent, your freedoms will erode and be subverted. This is not to say, Go "Burn, Loot &amp; Murder (BLM)", but to stamp
			out the bad actors by creating a massive cultural force that incentivises <b>true privacy &amp; anonymity technologies</b> and disincentive
			<b>bulk data collection &amp; anti-privacy / anti-anonymity technologies</b>. Yes, doing the physical part will be necesary to do
			(politically, culturally &amp; philosophically). However the real fight is the technology space, from the root: the software dev culture.
			<a href="https://suckless.org/">The Suckless Group</a> is a great start, but I won't deny that their software is not user friendly. If we can bridge
			the gap in where we can provide both the technology &amp; the education to the end users, thing <b>will snowball</b> into a direction that would be
			more desirable than the current direction we're heading towards.
			</p>

			<p>
			I will do an in-depth article on the current software developer's culture (which is absulutely disgusting, both at a software &amp; social level).
			If you want to know the gist of it, read my <a href="/cock.html">Code of Conduct</a> page. Its a bit unpolished (for now) but it explains the issue
			I have with it on a social level. There's way too much to go through on a technical aspects of it. So for now, Cheers!
