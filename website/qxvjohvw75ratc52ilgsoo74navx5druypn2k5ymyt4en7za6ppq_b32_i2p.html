    <p>
1. Download the following software from their official pages.<br>
-i2p/i2pd software for connecting the i2p network<br>
 Install and modify the settings as you prefer<br>
-MediaMTX simple media server<br>
-FFmpeg for converting/feeding the stream for the media server<br>
<br>
MediaMTX and FFmpeg are binaries only and don't need installation<br>
<br><br><br>
2. Modify MediaMTX ports the way you want (it creates the conf file on first boot)<br>
   Make notions of the port you are going to feed the stream in, since you need it for FFMpeg.<br>
   Also make notion of the HLS port, that one is needed later for i2p.<br>
   In my example MediaMTX RTSP port is 8367 and HLS port 8568.<br>
   OPTIONAL: You can disable WebRTC if you fear IP leaks and all other features unwanted.<br>
<br><br><br>
3. Configure FFMpeg to feed the stream for MediaMTX server, in my example we are using RTSP stream<br>
   Any other software, that is capable of streaming audio/video to server will do just fine as well.<br>
	<br>
	ffmpeg -re -rtsp_transport tcp -i "rtsp://admin:@192.168.1.112" -fps_mode passthrough -vcodec copy -acodec copy -f rtsp "rtsp://localhost:8367/mystream"<br>
	<br>
	With this line it re-streams rtsp stream from rtsp source, that has username, but no password.<br>
	Video, audio and FPS are passed through without encoding, in this example.<br>
	The output is the MediaMTX localhost address, where you need to add the port you used for RTSP.<br>
	In my example I keep the stream the same as source.<br>
	The /mystream is important in the end of the line, it is the identifier for the stream you need for the browser as well.<br>
	You can chose whatever word you want, but in this example it's /mystream<br>
<br><br><br>
4. Configure i2p to use HLS protocol/port through http server.<br>
- Open hidden services manager in i2p configuration<br>
- Choose New hidden service -&gt; HTTP and press create<br><br><br>

<span style="color:white;font-size:14px">(open the image in new tab, if you want to see it in full-size)</span><br><br><br>
- Enter name and description as you wish<br>
- OPTIONAL: If you keep the stream always on, you can tick 'Automatically start tunnel when router starts'<br>
- The port number is the one you chose for HLS in MediaMTX, which is 8568 in my example.<br>
- Choose Tunnel Performance Options -&gt; and select interactive connection from drop-down menu.<br>
- Otherwise the default settings will work already.<br>
- You can modify the connection settings later,<br>
  if your stream gets more popular and you need to allow more connections.<br><br>
- After everything is correct click save from the bottom of the page.<br>
- Start the server we just created and copy the hostname.<br>
<br><br><br>
5. Copy the hostname to the browser address line and add the /mystream to the end of the address.<br>
   Press enter and in a moment your stream should open, if you have done everything accordingly.<br>

These instructions are made with Windows software, but it should be just as easy in Linux, when just picking<br>
correct tools for the job.<br><br><br>
PS. With the forementioned method, it would be most likely possible to livestream from smart phones as well,
    if someone just puts up an app with all needed pieces inside.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
