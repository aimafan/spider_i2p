class="entry-content"><p> In the dynamic world of blockchain technology, a <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/research-notes/research-note-review-maximal-extractable-value-and-blockchain-oracles">Research Note</a> from authors at the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</a> and <a href="https://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London (UCL)</a> delves into the complex territories of <b>Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) and blockchain oracles</b>, presenting a nuanced study that underscores both the potential and the pitfalls of these advanced concepts in cryptoasset services and Decentralised Finance (DeFi). </p><p> At the heart of this exploration lies MEV, a concept that thrives on the transparency and ordering of transactions within blockchain networks. While it heralds a new era of value extraction, it also opens the door to strategies that may skirt the ethical line, raising concerns over market fairness and the integrity of transactional processes. From the beneficial arbitrage opportunities to the controversial practices of front-running and sandwich attacks, MEV presents a multifaceted phenomenon that demands a keen understanding of its implications. </p><p> Equally significant are blockchain oracles, pivotal in bridging the on-chain and off-chain worlds. These conduits of information are indispensable for the seamless operation of smart contracts, yet they bear vulnerabilities that can be exploited, casting a shadow over their reliability. The study highlights the delicate balance that must be struck in the design and implementation of oracles, stressing the importance of robust data sources, decentralisation, and innovative solutions to mitigate risks. </p><p><a href="/2024/02/06/exploring-the-edges-of-blockchain-technology-a-deep-dive-into-mev-and-oracles/#more-4425" class="more-link">Continue reading </a></p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><span class="posted-on"><a href="/2024/02/06/exploring-the-edges-of-blockchain-technology-a-deep-dive-into-mev-and-oracles/"><time class="entry-date published" datetime="2024-02-06T19:07:07+00:00">2024-02-06</time><time class="updated" datetime="2024-02-06T19:10:21+00:00">2024-02-06</time></a></span><span class="byline"><span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/agervais/" title="Posts by Arthur Gervais" class="author url fn">Arthur Gervais</a></span></span><span class="cat-links"><a href="/category/blockchain/">Blockchain</a>, <a href="/category/cryptocurrencies/">Cryptocurrencies</a>, <a href="/category/legal-issues/">Legal issues</a>, <a href="/category/public-policy/">Public policy</a></span><span class="comments-link"><a href="/2024/02/06/exploring-the-edges-of-blockchain-technology-a-deep-dive-into-mev-and-oracles/#respond">Leave a comment</a></span></footer></article><article id="post-4398" class="post-4398 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-blockchain category-cryptocurrencies category-cyber-crime category-law-enforcement category-legal-issues category-public-policy category-security-economics"><a class="post-thumbnail" href="/2023/05/17/a-regulatory-trial-and-error-phase-shaping-the-cryptocurrency-ecosystem/" aria-hidden="true"><img loading="lazy" width="825" height="510" src="/img/2023/05/pexels-alesia-kozik-6778650-scaled-e1684338557782-825x510.jpg&amp;w=1024&amp;we&amp;q=80&amp;output=webp&amp;il" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="A Regulatory “Trial and Error” Phase Shaping the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem" decoding="async"></a><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/2023/05/17/a-regulatory-trial-and-error-phase-shaping-the-cryptocurrency-ecosystem/">A Regulatory “Trial and Error” Phase Shaping the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem</a></h2></header><div class="entry-content"><p>In general, the broad aim of regulation is to organise the relationship between persons and to protect their rights and interests in society. However as we have discovered, this has not been the case within the cryptocurrency space.</p><p>It has been almost 15 years since Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper. Since then, this seminal document posted on a mailing list, catalysed the emergence of an entirely new-transnational field. Considering the substantial time that has passed and the widespread popularity of cryptocurrencies, one would expect regulators to have at least figured out ‘how’ and ‘what’ to regulate, right? But it appears not so. Regulators do not seem to want to provide long-term, serious solutions, but rather a collection of outdated bandages of reactions that mostly portray the illusion of a solution, with not-so-hidden intentions in mind.</p><p>The cryptocurrency ecosystem itself has often been compared to the Wild West. Nevertheless, this also applies to its journey to be regulated. A journey full of ill-suited regulatory approaches that resulted in a plethora of dilemmas. We explore this tension between the technology and regulation in our latest paper <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4398362">“Shaping Cryptocurrency Gatekeepers with a Regulatory ‘Trial and Error’”</a>, with a primary focus on the Financial Action Task Force’s recommendations, and the EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive.</p><p>Historically speaking, it was only after the rising popularity of the Silk Road and the collapse of the most popular (at the time) exchange Mt. Gox, that regulators realised that they needed to take action. The advertised main objective here is the curbing of criminal activity and providing regulatory protection to consumers/users. However, until only recently, most of the regulatory steps taken by most regulators choosing to act, were approaches mainly targeting money laundering and terrorist financing, with other limited initiatives here and there. Whilst this approach <em>might</em> have had <em>some</em> potential benefits, it was not 1. comprehensive, 2. global, 3. stable/constant, or 4. tailored to address the specific risks and characteristics of cryptocurrencies. In other words, different regulators have been testing diverse approaches, simultaneously, without engaging with one another, and without properly acknowledging the true needs and risks of the ecosystem.</p><p><a href="/2023/05/17/a-regulatory-trial-and-error-phase-shaping-the-cryptocurrency-ecosystem/#more-4398" class="more-link">Continue reading </a></p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><span class="posted-on"><a href="/2023/05/17/a-regulatory-trial-and-error-phase-shaping-the-cryptocurrency-ecosystem/"><time class="entry-date published" datetime="2023-05-17T15:53:39+00:00">2023-05-17</time><time class="updated" datetime="2023-05-17T15:54:29+00:00">2023-05-17</time></a></span><span class="byline"><span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/ordekian/" title="Posts by Marilyne Ordekian" class="author url fn">Marilyne Ordekian</a></span></span><span class="cat-links"><a href="/category/blockchain/">Blockchain</a>, <a href="/category/cryptocurrencies/">Cryptocurrencies</a>, <a href="/category/cyber-crime/">Cyber crime</a>, <a href="/category/law-enforcement/">Law enforcement</a>, <a href="/category/legal-issues/">Legal issues</a>, <a href="/category/public-policy/">Public policy</a>, <a href="/category/security-economics/">Security economics</a></span><span class="comments-link"><a href="/2023/05/17/a-regulatory-trial-and-error-phase-shaping-the-cryptocurrency-ecosystem/#comments">1 Comment</a></span></footer></article><article id="post-4377" class="post-4377 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-crime-science category-cryptocurrencies category-cyber-crime category-measurement category-research-projects category-security-economics category-talks-and-panels"><a class="post-thumbnail" href="/2023/04/28/rugpull-reports-in-the-defi-jungle/" aria-hidden="true"><img loading="lazy" width="825" height="510" src="/img/2023/04/AdobeStock_254155039-825x510.jpeg&amp;w=1024&amp;we&amp;q=80&amp;output=webp&amp;il" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Rugpull reports in the DeFi jungle" decoding="async"></a><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/2023/04/28/rugpull-reports-in-the-defi-jungle/">Rugpull reports in the DeFi jungle</a></h2></header><div class="entry-content"><p>A rising category of cryptocurrency scams called ‘rugpulls’ accounted for <a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/rs/503-FAP-074/images/Crypto-Crime-Report-2022.pdf">37% of all cryptocurrency scam revenue in 2021</a>. A rugpull is an exit scam in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) ecosystem where developers abandon a project without fully delivering and run away with investors’ funds. Thodex, a Turkish centralized exchange, ran away with $2 billion from victims. In March 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice charged two defendants for a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22995107/us-arrest-charges-crypto-nft-rug-pull-frosties-ethan-nguyen-andre-llacuna">$1.1 million NFT rugpull scam called Frosties.</a></p><p>In <a href="http://fc23.ifca.ai/preproceedings/76.pdf">our paper to be presented next week</a> at <a href="http://fc23.ifca.ai/index.html">Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2023</a>, we analyze&nbsp;an updated list of rugpulls from an online discussion forum – <a href="http://www.bitcointalk.org">bitcointalk.org</a>. This forum provides a platform for everyone to discuss anything on crypto that also attracts scammers to advertise their projects. We observe that since 2020, the number of rugpull threads has increased, while the ones containing exit scams have decreased; the total mention of either of these terms is relatively stable over time.

Last month during the tax-paying season of the year, I (<a href="https://sharad1126.github.io/">Sharad Agarwal)</a>, a Ph.D. student at University College London (UCL) researching SMS phishing, found and identified an updated version of the Drinik malware that impersonates the Income Tax Department of India and targets the victim’s UPI (Unified Payment Interface) payment apps.</p><p>The iAssist.apk malware was being spread from the URL <em>hxxp://198[.]46[.]177[.]176/IT-R/?id={mobile number}</em> where the user is deceived into downloading a new version of the app, impersonating the Income Tax Department of India. Along with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9mhj4AQAAAAJ">Daniel Arp</a>, I analyzed the malware sample to check for new functionalities compared to previous versions. In the following, we give a brief overview of our findings.</p><h3><strong>Communication</strong></h3><p>Our analysis found that the malware communicates with the Command &amp; Control (C&amp;C) server <em>hxxp://msr[.]servehttp[.]com</em>, which is hosted on IP <em>107[.]174[.]45[.]116</em>. It also silently drops another malicious APK file hosted on the C&amp;C to the victim’s mobile that has already been identified and flagged as malware on <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/095fde0070e8c1a10342ab0c1edbed659456947a2d4ee9a412f1cd1ff50eb797">VirusTotal</a> – “<em>GAnalytics.apk</em>“.</p><p>The previous campaign used a different IP for its C&amp;C communication. However, the hosting provider for the IP addresses, “<em>ColoCrossing</em>“, is the same as in the previous campaign. This strongly indicates that the Threat Actor behind both campaigns is also the same and is abusing the same hosting provider again. As has already been reported for previous versions of this malware, also the most recent version of the malware records the screen of the mobile device and sends the recorded data to the C&amp;C server (see Figure 1).</p><figure id="attachment_4360" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4360" style="width: 954px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/img/2023/04/video_upload.png&amp;w=1024&amp;we&amp;q=80&amp;output=webp&amp;il"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-4360 size-full" src="/img/2023/04/video_upload.png&amp;w=1024&amp;we&amp;q=80&amp;output=webp&amp;il" alt="Function to upload recorded videos to external C&amp;C server." width="954" height="281"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4360" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1: Function to upload recorded videos to external C&amp;C server.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, we also found the phone numbers used by the criminals to which the SMSs are sent through this malware (see Table 1).

Since the part of the image cropped out might contain sensitive information, this was a serious security issue. The problem occurred because the Android API changed behaviour from truncating files by default to <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/180526528">leaving existing content in place</a>. Consequently, the beginning of the resulting image file contains the cropped content, but the end of the original file is still present. Image viewers ignore this data and open the file as usual, but with some <a href="https://www.da.vidbuchanan.co.uk/blog/exploiting-acropalypse.html">clever analysis of the compression algorithm</a> used, the original image can (partially) be recovered.</p><p>Shortly after the vulnerability was announced, someone noticed that the Windows default screenshot tool, Snip and Sketch, <a href="https://twitter.com/ProgramMax/status/1638217206180741121">appeared to have the same problem</a>, despite being an entirely unrelated application on a different operating system. I also found <a href="https://murdoch.is/talks/ccc04_hiddendata.pdf">a similar problem back in 2004</a> relating to JPEG thumbnail images. When the same vulnerability keeps re-occurring, it suggests a systemic problem in how we build software, so I set out to understand more about the reasons for the vulnerability existing in Windows Snip and Sketch.</p><h2>A flawed API</h2><p>The first problem I found is that the modern Windows API for saving files had a very similar problem to that in Android. Specifically, existing files would not be truncated by default. Arguably the vulnerability was worse because, unlike Android, there is no option to truncate files. The Windows documentation is, at best, unclear on the need to truncate files and what code is needed to achieve the desired result.</p><p>This wasn’t always the case. The old <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/commdlg/nf-commdlg-getsavefilenamew">Win32 API for saving a file</a> was (roughly) to show a file picker, get the filename the user selected, and then open the file. To open a file, the programmer must <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilew">specify whether to overwrite the file or not</a>, and example code usually does overwrite the file. However, the new “more secure” Universal Windows Platform (UWP) sandboxes the file picker in a separate process, allowing neat features like capability-based access control. It <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.storage.pickers.filesavepicker.picksavefileasync">creates the file if needed and returns a handle which</a>, if the selected file exists, will not overwrite the existing content.</p><p>However, from the documentation, a programmer would understandably assume, however, that the file would be empty.</p><blockquote><p>“The file name, extension, and location of this storageFile match those specified by the user, but the file has no content.”</p></blockquote><p><a href="/2023/04/19/the-acropalypse-vulnerability-in-windows-snip-and-sketch-lessons-for-developer-centered-security/#more-4336" class="more-link">Continue reading </a></p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><span class="posted-on"><a href="/2023/04/19/the-acropalypse-vulnerability-in-windows-snip-and-sketch-lessons-for-developer-centered-security/"><time class="entry-date published" datetime="2023-04-19T10:02:42+00:00">2023-04-19</time><time class="updated" datetime="2023-04-19T10:06:19+00:00">2023-04-19</time></a></span><span class="byline"><span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/smurdoch/" title="Posts by Steven J.

In recent years increasing attention has been given to this phenomenon in school settings and the criminal justice system. Yet, an awareness in the healthcare sector is lacking. To address this gap, Dr Isabel Straw and Dr Leonie Tanczer from University College London (UCL) have been leading a new research project that examines technology-facilitated abuse in medical settings.</p><p>Technology-facilitated forms of abuse are on the rise, with perpetrators adapting digital technologies such as <a href="https://www.californialawreview.org/print/a-domestic-violence-dystopia-abuse-via-the-internet-of-things-and-remedies-under-current-law/">smartphones and drones, trackers such as AirTags</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/JAP-03-2021-0009">spyware tools including parental control software, to cause harm</a>. The impact of technology-facilitated abuse on patients may not always be immediately obvious to healthcare professionals. For instance, smart, Internet-connected devices <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200511-how-smart-home-devices-are-being-used-for-domestic-abuse">have been showcased to be misused in domestic abuse cases to inflict physical harm</a>. Smart locks have been used to trap individuals inside their homes, smart thermostats have been used to inflict extremes of temperature on victims, and remotely controlled lighting and sound systems have been manipulated to cause psychological distress. COVID-19 catalyzed the <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/stalkerware-spy-apps-on-smartphones-spike-during-the-pandemic-1069593">proliferation of these technologies within our environment</a>, with sales of smart devices increasing 30% on last year. Yet, while these tools are advertised for their proposed safety and convenience, they are also providing new avenues for violence, harassment, and abuse.</p><p>The impact of technology-facilitated abuse is especially notable on young people. In recent years, pediatric safeguarding guidelines have been amended in response to increasing rates of <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/mopac_knife_crime_strategy_june_2017.pdf">knife crime</a>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2012-050940">gang violence</a> and drug trafficking in the UK. However, technology-facilitated abuse has evolved at a parallel rate and has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-online-hate-harassment-and-abuse-a-rapid-evidence-assessment">not received the same level of attention</a>. The impact of technology-facilitated abuse on children and teenagers may manifest as <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/research/technology-facilitated-abuse-women-intellectual-or-cognitive-disability">emotional distress, anxiety, suicidal ideation</a>. Koubel reports the <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/safeguarding-adults-and-children-9781137484611/">exacerbation of mental health risks born from websites that encourage self-harm, eating disorders, and suicide</a>. Furthermore, technology-facilitated dating abuse and sextortion is increasing amongst adolescent populations. With 10% of children being affected by sexual solicitation online, the problem is widespread and under-investigated. As reported by Stonard et al. in “<em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260515590787">They’ll Always Find a Way to Get to You</a>”</em>, digital devices are playing an increasing role in relationship abuse amongst young people.</p><p>Vulnerable individuals frequently perceive medical settings as a place of safety. Healthcare professionals, thus, have a role in providing both medical and psychosocial care to ensure their wellbeing. At present, existing clinical and patient management protocols are outdated and do not address the emerging threats of technology-facilitated abuse. For clinicians to provide effective care to patients affected by technological elements of abuse and violence, clinical safeguarding protocols need a radical update if they are to assist professionals navigating high risk scenarios.</p><p><a href="/2022/09/01/i-am-yet-to-meet-a-young-person-that-has-not-experienced-some-form-of-abuse-via-tech/#more-4256" class="more-link">Continue reading </a></p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><span class="posted-on"><a href="/2022/09/01/i-am-yet-to-meet-a-young-person-that-has-not-experienced-some-form-of-abuse-via-tech/"><time class="entry-date published" datetime="2022-09-01T08:55:29+00:00">2022-09-01</time><time class="updated" datetime="2022-08-31T15:56:50+00:00">2022-08-31</time></a></span><span class="byline"><span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/istraw/" title="Posts by Isabel Straw" class="author url fn">Isabel Straw</a></span></span><span class="cat-links"><a href="/category/cyber-crime/">Cyber crime</a>, <a href="/category/hardware/">Hardware</a>, <a href="/category/law-enforcement/">Law enforcement</a>, <a href="/category/legal-issues/">Legal issues</a>, <a href="/category/mobile/">Mobile</a>, <a href="/category/privacy/">Privacy</a>, <a href="/category/public-policy/">Public policy</a>, <a href="/category/research-projects/">Research projects</a>, <a href="/category/security-usability/">Security usability</a></span><span class="comments-link"><a href="/2022/09/01/i-am-yet-to-meet-a-young-person-that-has-not-experienced-some-form-of-abuse-via-tech/#comments">2 Comments</a></span></footer></article><article id="post-4232" class="post-4232 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-operating-systems"><a class="post-thumbnail" href="/2022/08/22/vulnerability-in-linux-containers-investigation-and-mitigation/" aria-hidden="true"><img loading="lazy" width="825" height="510" src="/img/2022/08/mohammad-rahmani-1VW6HLOQE5A-unsplash-scaled-e1661105918723-825x510.jpg&amp;w=1024&amp;we&amp;q=80&amp;output=webp&amp;il" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Vulnerability in Linux containers – investigation and mitigation" decoding="async"></a><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/2022/08/22/vulnerability-in-linux-containers-investigation-and-mitigation/">Vulnerability in Linux containers – investigation and mitigation</a></h2></header><div class="entry-content"><p>Operating system access controls, that constrain which programs can open which files, have existed for almost as long as computers themselves. Access controls are still widely used and are more flexible and efficient when compared to cryptographically protecting files. Despite the long history, there continues to be innovation in access control, particularly now in containers, like Docker and Kubernetes and similar technologies offered by cloud providers. Here, rather than running lots of software on a single computer, the service is split up into microservices running in containers. Each container is isolated from others on the same computer as if it has its own computer and operating system and is prevented from reading files in other containers.</p><p>However, in reality, there’s only one operating system, and the container runtime’s role is to create the illusion that there are more than one. As part of its job, the runtime should also set up containers such that access control works inside each container because not every program running inside a container should be able to access every file. Multiple containers can also be given access to the same directory, and access controls used to restrict what each container can do with the directory contents. If access controls don’t work properly, an attacker could read or modify files they should not be able to.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is such a vulnerability. The bad news is that it originates from an omission in the specification that underlies all the major container runtimes and so is present regardless of which container runtime you use (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">runc</a>, <a href="https://github.com/containers/crun">crun</a>, <a href="https://katacontainers.io/">Kata Containers</a>) and regardless of whether you use containers directly (e.g. through <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> or <a href="https://podman.io/">podman</a>) or indirectly (e.g. through <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>). The good news is that the vulnerability affects a feature of Linux access control permissions that is not widely used – negative group permissions. However, if your system does depend on this feature then the vulnerability could be serious. Read on for more details about the vulnerability, why it exists and what can be done to mitigate the problem.</p><h2>Introduction to Linux permissions</h2><p>In Linux there are user accounts and each user is also a member of a group. Each object (files, directories, devices, etc.) has an associated owner and associated group. The object also has a set of permissions associated with the three classes: owner, group, and other. These permissions tell the operating system whether a user should be able to read from the object (r), write to the object (w) and execute the object (x). If a user is the owner of an object the owner-class permissions are used, if the user is a member of the file’s group, the group-class permissions are used, and otherwise the other-class permissions are used.</p><p>For example, a file containing a company’s finance database could be owned by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and have owner class permissions “r+w”. It could have the group set to “auditors” with group-class permissions only “r” and other-class permissions set to nothing. Then the CFO could freely read and write to the database, all members of the group auditors could read it, and everyone else cannot access the database at all.</p><p><a href="/2022/08/22/vulnerability-in-linux-containers-investigation-and-mitigation/#more-4232" class="more-link">Continue reading </a></p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><span class="posted-on"><a href="/2022/08/22/vulnerability-in-linux-containers-investigation-and-mitigation/"><time class="entry-date published" datetime="2022-08-22T13:14:20+00:00">2022-08-22</time><time class="updated" datetime="2023-02-16T16:52:48+00:00">2023-02-16</time></a></span><span class="byline"><span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/smurdoch/" title="Posts by Steven J.

Therefore, evidence produced by computers is treated as reliable unless other evidence suggests otherwise. This way of handling evidence is known as a ‘rebuttable presumption’. A court will treat a computer as if it is working perfectly unless someone can show why that is not the case.</p><p>This presumption poses a challenge to those who dispute evidence produced by a computer system. Frequently the challenge is insurmountable, particularly where a substantial institution operates the system.</p><p>The Post Office Horizon scandal clearly exposes the problem and the harm that may result. From 1999, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of postmasters and Post Office employees for theft and fraud based on evidence produced by the Horizon computer system showing shortfalls in their branch accounts. In those prosecutions, the Post Office relied on the presumption that computers were operating correctly.</p><p>Hundreds of postmasters and others were convicted, sentenced to terms of imprisonment, fined, or had their property confiscated. This clearly demonstrated that the Law Commission’s assertion that ‘such a regime would work fairly’ was flawed.</p><p>In the December 2019 judgment in the group litigation <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2019/3408.html"><em>Bates v The Post Office Ltd (No 6: Horizon Issues) Rev 1</em></a>, Mr Justice Fraser concluded that it was possible that software errors in Horizon could have caused apparent shortfalls in branch accounts, rather than these being due to theft or fraud. Following this judgement, the Criminal Cases Review Commission referred an unprecedented number of convictions, based upon the supposed shortfalls in the Horizon accounts, to the Court of Appeal. Appeal courts have quashed more than 70 convictions at the time of writing. There will be many more appeals and many more convictions quashed in what is likely the largest miscarriage of justice in British history.</p><p>Were it not for the group litigation, the fundamental unreliability of the software in the Post Office’s Horizon computer system would not have been revealed, as previous challenges to Horizon’s correctness were unable to rebut the presumption of reliability for computer evidence. The financial risk of bringing legal action deterred other challenges. Similar issues apply in other situations where the reliability of computer evidence is questioned, such as in payment disputes.</p><p>The legal presumption, as applied in practice, has exposed widespread misunderstanding about the nature of computer failures – in particular, the fact that these are almost invariably failures of software. The presumption has been the cause of widespread injustice.</p><p><a href="/2022/06/30/the-legal-rule-that-computers-are-presumed-to-be-operating-correctly-unforeseen-and-unjust-consequences/#more-4184" class="more-link">Continue reading </a></p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><span class="posted-on"><a href="/2022/06/30/the-legal-rule-that-computers-are-presumed-to-be-operating-correctly-unforeseen-and-unjust-consequences/"><time class="entry-date published" datetime="2022-06-30T12:06:41+00:00">2022-06-30</time><time class="updated" datetime="2022-10-04T17:11:07+00:00">2022-10-04</time></a></span><span class="byline"><span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/nicholas-bohm/" title="Posts by Nicholas Bohm" class="author url fn">Nicholas Bohm</a></span>, <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/james-christie/" title="Posts by James Christie" class="author url fn">James Christie</a></span>, <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/peter-bernard-ladkin/" title="Posts by Peter Bernard Ladkin" class="author url fn">Peter Bernard Ladkin</a></span>, <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/bev-littlewood/" title="Posts by Bev Littlewood" class="author url fn">Bev Littlewood</a></span>, <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/paul-marshall/" title="Posts by Paul Marshall" class="author url fn">Paul Marshall</a></span>, <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/stephen-mason/" title="Posts by Stephen Mason" class="author url fn">Stephen Mason</a></span>, <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/martin-newby/" title="Posts by Martin Newby" class="author url fn">Martin Newby</a></span>, <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/smurdoch/" title="Posts by Steven J.
