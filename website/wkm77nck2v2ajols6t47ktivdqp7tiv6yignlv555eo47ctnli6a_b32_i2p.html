All that email was supposed to achieve was being forwarded to you. However, the moment the email appeared in your inbox, it changed. The innocent pretext disappeared and the real phishing email became visible. A phishing email you <i>had</i> to trust because you knew the sender and they even confirmed that they had forwarded it to you.</p><p>This attack is possible because most email clients allow CSS to be used to style HTML emails. When an email is forwarded, the position of the original email in the DOM usually changes, allowing for CSS rules to be selectively applied only when an email has been forwarded.</p><p>An attacker can use this to include elements in the email that appear or disappear depending on the context in which the email is viewed. Because they are usually invisible, only appear in certain circumstances, and can be used for all sorts of mischief, I'll refer to these elements as <i>kobold letters</i>, after the elusive sprites of mythology.</p></blockquote><p>I can certainly imagine the possibilities.</p><p class="entry-tags"><span class="tags-links">Tags: <a href="/tag/email/">email</a>, <a href="/tag/spoofing/">spoofing</a>, <a href="/tag/vulnerabilities/">vulnerabilities</a></span></p><p class="posted"><a href="/blog/archives/2024/04/security-vulnerability-of-html-emails.html">Posted on April 8, 2024 at 7:03 AM</a>•<a href="/blog/archives/2024/04/security-vulnerability-of-html-emails.html#comments">13 Comments</a></p></div></article><article id="post-68726" class="post-68726 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized tag-artificial-intelligence tag-robotics tag-squid"><div class="article"><h2 class="entry"><a href="/blog/archives/2024/04/friday-squid-blogging-squid-bots.html">Friday Squid Blogging: SqUID Bots</a></h2><p>They're AI warehouse <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/squid-robots-musk-automate-warehouse">robots</a>.</p><p>As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.</p><p>Read my blog posting guidelines <a href="/blog/archives/2017/03/commenting_poli.html">here</a>.</p><p class="entry-tags"><span class="tags-links">Tags: <a href="/tag/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="/tag/robotics/">robotics</a>, <a href="/tag/squid/">squid</a></span></p><p class="posted"><a href="/blog/archives/2024/04/friday-squid-blogging-squid-bots.html">Posted on April 5, 2024 at 5:02 PM</a>•<a href="/blog/archives/2024/04/friday-squid-blogging-squid-bots.html#comments">74 Comments</a></p></div></article><article id="post-68724" class="post-68724 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized tag-infrastructure tag-phones tag-protocols tag-vulnerabilities"><div class="article"><h2 class="entry"><a href="/blog/archives/2024/04/maybe-the-phone-system-surveillance-vulnerabilities-will-be-fixed.html">Maybe the Phone System Surveillance Vulnerabilities Will Be Fixed</a></h2><p>It seems that the FCC might be <a href="https://www.theregister.com/AMP/2024/04/02/fcc_ss7_security/">fixing the vulnerabilities</a> in SS7 and the Diameter protocol:</p><blockquote><p>On March 27 the commission asked telecommunications providers to weigh in and detail what they are doing to prevent SS7 and Diameter vulnerabilities from being misused to track consumers' locations.</p><p>The FCC has also asked carriers to detail any exploits of the protocols since 2018.

An intentionally placed backdoor in xz Utils, an open-source compression utility, was pretty much <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4">accidentally discovered</a> by a Microsoft engineer—weeks before it would have been incorporated into both Debian and Red Hat Linux. From <a href="http://arstechnica.i2p/security/2024/04/what-we-know-about-the-xz-utils-backdoor-that-almost-infected-the-world/">ArsTehnica</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Malicious code added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 modified the way the software functions. The backdoor manipulated sshd, the executable file used to make remote SSH connections. Anyone in possession of a predetermined encryption key could stash any code of their choice in an SSH login certificate, upload it, and execute it on the backdoored device. No one has actually seen code uploaded, so it's not known what code the attacker planned to run. In theory, the code could allow for just about anything, including stealing encryption keys or installing malware.</p></blockquote><p>It was an <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@fr0gger/112189232773640259">incredibly complex backdoor</a>. Installing it was a multi-year process that seems to have involved <a href="https://twitter.com/robmen/status/1774067844785086775">social</a><a href="https://boehs.org/node/everything-i-know-about-the-xz-backdoor">engineering</a> the lone unpaid engineer in charge of the utility. More from ArsTechnica:</p><blockquote><p>In 2021, someone with the username JiaT75 made their <a href="https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/pull/1609">first known commit</a> to an open source project. In retrospect, the change to the libarchive project is suspicious, because it replaced the safe_fprint function with a variant that has long been recognized as less secure. No one noticed at the time.</p><p>The following year, JiaT75 submitted a patch over the xz Utils mailing list, and, almost immediately, a never-before-seen participant named Jigar Kumar joined the discussion and argued that Lasse Collin, the longtime maintainer of xz Utils, hadn't been updating the software often or fast enough. Kumar, with the support of Dennis Ens and several other people who had never had a presence on the list, pressured Collin to bring on an additional developer to maintain the project.</p></blockquote><p>There's a lot more. The sophistication of both the exploit and the process to get it into the software project scream nation-state operation. It's reminiscent of Solar Winds, although (1) it would have been much, much worse, and (2) we got really, really lucky.</p><p>I simply don't believe this was the only attempt to slip a backdoor into a critical piece of Internet software, either closed source or open source. Given how lucky we were to detect this one, I believe this kind of operation has been successful in the past. We simply have to stop building our critical national infrastructure <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">on top of</a> random software libraries managed by lone unpaid distracted—or worse—individuals.</p><p class="entry-tags"><span class="tags-links">Tags: <a href="/tag/backdoors/">backdoors</a>, <a href="/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a>, <a href="/tag/hacking/">hacking</a>, <a href="/tag/malware/">malware</a>, <a href="/tag/open-source/">open source</a>, <a href="/tag/social-engineering/">social engineering</a></span></p><p class="posted"><a href="/blog/archives/2024/04/xz-utils-backdoor.html">Posted on April 2, 2024 at 2:50 PM</a>•<a href="/blog/archives/2024/04/xz-utils-backdoor.html#comments">63 Comments</a></p></div></article><article id="post-68665" class="post-68665 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized tag-applied-cryptography tag-foia tag-history-of-cryptography tag-history-of-security tag-nsa"><div class="article"><h2 class="entry"><a href="/blog/archives/2024/04/declassified-nsa-newsletters.html">Declassified NSA Newsletters</a></h2><p>Through a 2010 FOIA request (yes, it took that long), we have copies of the NSA's KRYPTOS Society Newsletter, "<a href="https://www.governmentattic.org/53docs/NSAkryptosSocNwsltrs1994-2003.pdf">Tales of the Krypt</a>," from 1994 to 2003.</p><p>There are many interesting things in the 800 pages of newsletter. There are many redactions. And a 1994 review of <i>Applied Cryptography</i> by <b>redacted</b>:</p><blockquote><p>Applied Cryptography, for those who don't read the internet news, is a book written by Bruce Schneier last year. According to the jacket, Schneier is a data security expert with a master's degree in computer science. According to his followers, he is a hero who has finally brought together the loose threads of cryptography for the general public to understand. Schneier has gathered academic research, internet gossip, and everything he could find on cryptography into one 600-page jumble.</p><p>The book is destined for commercial success because it is the only volume in which everything linked to cryptography is mentioned. It has sections on such-diverse topics as number theory, zero knowledge proofs, complexity, protocols, DES, patent law, and the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility. Cryptography is a hot topic just now, and Schneier stands alone in having written a book on it which can be browsed: it is not too dry.</p><p>Schneier gives prominence to applications with large sections.on protocols and source code. Code is given for IDEA, FEAL, triple-DES, and other algorithms. At first glance, the book has the look of an encyclopedia of cryptography. Unlike an encyclopedia, however, it can't be trusted for accuracy.</p><p>Playing loose with the facts is a serious problem with Schneier. For example in discussing a small-exponent attack on RSA, he says "an attack by Michael Wiener will recover e when e is up to one quarter the size of n." Actually, Wiener's attack recovers the secret exponent d when e has less than one quarter as many bits as n, which is a quite different statement. Or: "The quadratic sieve is the fastest known algorithm for factoring numbers less than 150 digits…. The number field sieve is the fastest known factoring algorithm, although the quadratric sieve is still faster for smaller numbers (the break even point is between 110 and 135 digits)." Throughout the book, Schneier leaves the impression of sloppiness, of a quick and dirty exposition. The reader is subjected to the grunge of equations, only to be confused or misled. The large number of errors compounds the problem. A recent version of the errata (Schneier publishes updates on the internet) is fifteen pages and growing, including errors in diagrams, errors in the code, and errors in the bibliography.</p><p>Many readers won't notice that the details are askew. The importance of the book is that it is the first stab at.putting the whole subject in one spot. Schneier aimed to provide a "comprehensive reference work for modern cryptography." Comprehensive it is. A trusted reference it is not.</p></blockquote><p>Ouch. But I will not argue that some of my math was sloppy, especially in the first edition (with the blue cover, not the red cover).</p><p>A few other highlights:</p><ul><li>1995 Kryptos Kristmas Kwiz, pages 299–306</li><li>1996 Kryptos Kristmas Kwiz, pages 414–420</li><li>1998 Kryptos Kristmas Kwiz, pages 659–665</li><li>1999 Kryptos Kristmas Kwiz, pages 734–738</li><li>Dundee Society Introductory Placement Test (from questions posed by Lambros Callimahos in his famous class), pages 771–773</li><li>R.

Of course it was before 2008, when we created the <a href="/blog/archives/2023/06/security-and-human-behavior-shb-2023.html">Security and Human Behavior</a> workshop. It was well before 2001, when we created the <a href="https://econinfosec.org/">Workshop on Economics and Information Security</a>. (Okay, he created both—I helped.) It was before 1998, when we <a href="/academic/archives/1997/04/the_risks_of_key_rec.html">wrote about</a> the problems with key escrow systems. I was one of the people he brought to the Newton Institute, at Cambridge University, for the six-month cryptography residency program he ran (I mistakenly didn't stay the whole time)—that was in 1996.</p><p>I know I was at the first <a href="https://iacr.org/meetings/fse/">Fast Software Encryption</a> workshop in December 1993, another conference he created. There I presented the <a href="/academic/archives/1994/09/description_of_a_new.html">Blowfish</a> encryption algorithm. Pulling an old first-edition of <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Cryptography-Protocols-Algorithms-Source/dp/0471597562">Applied Cryptography</a></i> (the one with the blue cover) down from the shelf, I see his name in the acknowledgments. Which means that sometime in early 1993—probably at Eurocrypt in Lofthus, Norway—I, as an unpublished book author who had only written a couple of crypto articles for <i>Dr. Dobb's Journal</i>, asked him to read and comment on my book manuscript. And he said yes. Which means I mailed him a paper copy. And he read it. And mailed his handwritten comments back to me. In an envelope with stamps. Because that's how we did it back then.</p><p>I have known Ross for over thirty years, as both a colleague and a friend. He was enthusiastic, brilliant, opinionated, articulate, curmudgeonly, and kind. Pick up any of his academic papers—there are <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/#Research">many</a>—and odds are that you will find a least one unexpected insight. He was a cryptographer and security engineer, but also very much a generalist. He published on block cipher cryptanalysis in the 1990s, and the security of large-language models last year. He started conferences like nobody's business. His masterwork book, <i><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html">Security Engineering</a></i>—now in its third edition—is as comprehensive a tome on cybersecurity and related topics as you could imagine. (Also note his fifteen-lecture video series on that same page. If you have never heard Ross lecture, you're in for a treat.) He was the <a href="https://www.acsac.org/2001/papers/110.pdf">first person</a> to understand that security problems are often actually <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/econsec.html">economic problems</a>. He was the first person to make a lot of those sorts of connections. He fought against surveillance and backdoors, and for academic freedom. He didn't suffer fools in either government or the corporate world.</p><p>He's listed in the acknowledgments as a reader of every one of my books from <a href="/books/beyond-fear/"><i>Beyond Fear</i></a> on. Recently, we'd see each other a couple of times a year: at this or that workshop or event. The last time I saw him was last June, at <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/SHB2023/index.htm">SHB 2023</a>, in Pittsburgh. We were having dinner on <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/">Alessandro Acquisti</a>‘s rooftop patio, celebrating another successful workshop. He was going to attend my <a href="/blog/archives/2024/01/second-interdisciplinary-workshop-on-reimagining-democracy.html">Workshop on Reimagining Democracy</a> in December, but he had to cancel at the last minute. (He sent me the talk he was going to give. I will see about posting it.)
